THE VENUS CHEMICAL MICROSENSOR ARRAY (VCMA)  WHICH HAS BEEN SEPARATELY DEVELOPED AND DEMONSTRATED UNDER A NASA PHASE II SBIR  CONSISTS OF HIGHLY SELECTIVE  SOLID STATE CHEMICAL MICROSENSORS (CO  NO  OCS  SOX  O2  H2O  HF  AND HCL) THAT CAN OPERATE AT AND ABOVE 500 DEGREES CELSIUS  BUT RELIES ON SILICON-BASED SUPPORT ELECTRONICS LIMITED TO 125 DEGREES CELSIUS OPERATION. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SIC ELECTRONICS IS THE KEY TO ENABLE UNCOOLED LONG DURATION OPERATION AT THE SURFACE OF VENUS. WE WILL DESIGN AND FABRICATE APPLICATION SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS (ASICS) USING NASA DEMONSTRATED SIC TECHNOLOGY TO ENABLE LONG LIVED (100S OF DAYS) CHEMICAL SENSOR MEASUREMENTS ON VENUS  SURFACE. THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF CORE SIC ELECTRONICS FOR AMPLIFICATION  ANALOG CONTROL FEEDBACK  AND ANALOG TO DIGITAL DATA CONVERSION REQUIRED FOR SENSOR OPERATION. DEVELOPMENT WILL BE BASED ON PREVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED SIC COMPONENTS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN COMBINED INTO THE HIGH LEVEL INTEGRATED CIRCUITS NEEDED TO SUPPORT MANY TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS  INCLUDING VCMA. MATURATION OF HIGH TEMPERATURE ELECTRONICS REDUCES RISK TO FUTURE INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT  SUPPORTING OVERALL MISSION OBJECTIVES AND PROVIDING SCIENCE RELEVANT TO DECADAL AND VENUS EXPLORATION ANALYSIS GROUP (VEXAG) GOALS. MAKEL ENGINEERING  INC. (MEI) WORKING ALONG WITH CO-PI S FROM NASA GRC AND NASA JPL WILL USE THE NASA GRC MICROFABRICATION FACILITIES FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THE SIC ELECTRONICS. MEI WILL PROVIDE THE EXPERTISE ON SPECIFIC CIRCUIT DESIGNS AND ASIC ARCHITECTURE FOR THE MICROSENSORS. NASA GRC WILL PROVIDE EXPERTISE ON CIRCUIT IMPLEMENTATION IN SIC AND DEVICE FABRICATION USING THE NASA GRC MICROSYSTEMS FABRICATION LABORATORY. DEMONSTRATION AND VALIDATION OF THE ELECTRONICS WILL BE CONDUCTED BY MEI AN JPL BY INCORPORATING THE SIC ELECTRONICS WITH THE VCMA INTO A SENSING PACKAGE FOR USE IN JPL S ONGOING TERRESTRIAL VOLCANIC TEST PROGRAM WHICH SERVES AS A HOT PLANETARY TESTBED. THE DECADAL SURVEY IDENTIFIES THE VENUS IN-SITU EXPLORER MISSION (VISE) FOR NEW FRONTIERS TO  IN PART   UNDERSTAND THE PROPERTIES OF VENUS S ATMOSPHERE DOWN TO THE SURFACE.  NEAR/ON-SURFACE EXPLORATION REQUIRES HIGH TEMPERATURE SYSTEMS AND  HIGH-TEMPERATURE SURVIVABILITY TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS ELECTRONICS WILL ENABLE LONG-TERM IN SITU MISSIONS . THE VENUS EXPLORATION WORKING GROUP TECHNOLOGY PLAN SIMILARLY EMPHASIZES THAT  DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE ELECTRONICS  SENSORS  DESIGNED FOR OPERATING IN THE VENUS AMBIENT WOULD BE ENABLING FOR FUTURE MISSIONS . HOWEVER  THE TECHNOLOGY FOR SUCH NEW FRONTIER EXPLORATION IS LIMITED AND MATURATION FOR FUTURE MISSIONS IS NEEDED. THIS PROPOSAL DIRECTLY ADDRESSES VISE S NEEDS FOR TECHNOLOGY OPERATIONAL FOR EXTENDED PERIODS AT THE SURFACE OF VENUS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SIC ELECTRONICS AND THE DEMONSTRATION OF THE ELECTRONICS INTEGRATED WITH EXISTING HARSH ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL SENSORS IN TERRESTRIAL SURROGATE ENVIRONMENTS WILL BRING THE TECHNOLOGY TO A HIGH MATURITY LEVEL.","","2018","$14,052","$0","$14,052","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","California", "","","","",""
"TENAGRA OBSERVATORIES  LTD.","","United States","","","","","WE PROPOSE TO UTILIZE 100% OF THE TIME ON THE TENAGRA II 0.81-M F/7 RITCHEY-CHR TIEN TELESCOPE AND ON THE TENAGRA III 0.41-M F/3.75 ASTROGRAPH (NEAR RIO RICO  AZ) TO PERFORM ASTROMETRIC OBSERVATIONS OF NEOS  WITH THE PRIMARY GOALS OF (A) CONFIRMING NEWLY DISCOVERED NEO CANDIDATES POSTED ON THE NEO CONFIRMATION PAGE (NEOCP)  CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR INITIAL ORBIT AND ABSOLUTE MAGNITUDE DETERMINATION  (B) EXTENDING THE OBSERVED ARCS OF RECENTLY DISCOVERED NEOS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE DURING THEIR DISCOVERY APPARITIONS  AND (C) RECOVERING SINGLE-OPPOSITION NEOS AT A SECOND APPARITION. CURRENTLY  50% OF THE 0.81-M TELESCOPE'S TIME IS BEING USED FOR NEO OBSERVATIONS  WHICH RESULTED IN 3 000 NEO OBSERVATIONS AND 26 RECOVERIES OF ONE-OPPOSITION NEOS BETWEEN LATE SEPTEMBER 2013 AND EARLY APRIL 2014. THE 0.81-M TELESCOPE IS FULLY AUTOMATED  AND CAN DETECT NEOS DOWN TO V ~ 21.5-21.7 IN UP TO ~ 10 MIN OF EXPOSURE  IN MOST CASES WITH SINGLE EXPOSURES TRACKED ON THE TARGET'S MOTION. THIS MAKES NEARLY ALL OBJECTS CURRENTLY BEING POSTED ON THE NEOCP ACCESSIBLE TO OBSERVATION. THE 0.41-M TELESCOPE  ALSO FULLY AUTOMATED  HAS A 1.35 DEGREE X 1.35 DEGREE FIELD-OFVIEW  WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR FOLLOW-UP AND RECOVERIES OF NEOS DOWN TO V ~ 20.8 HAVING EPHEMERIS UNCERTAINTIES UP TO TENS OF DEGREES. TO MAXIMIZE THE RELEVANCE OF EACH NIGHT'S OBSERVATIONS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OR NEO ORBITS  TARGET SELECTION TAKES INTO ACCOUNT PARAMETERS SUCH AS EPHEMERIS UNCERTAINTIES  OBSERVED ARCS  LENGTHS OF OBSERVABILITY WINDOWS  AND NEOCP SCORES. FULLY AUTOMATED IMAGE ACQUISITION AND EFFICIENT OBSERVATION SCHEDULING MINIMIZE TELESCOPE IDLE TIME AND MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF NEO OBSERVATIONS PER NIGHT. UNATTENDED REAL-TIME MOVING OBJECT DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION IS DONE ON SITE WITH THE HELP OF A PIPELINE (SKYSIFT)  ALLOWING FAST HUMAN VALIDATION/REJECTION OF THE RESULTING DETECTIONS  AS WELL AS RAPID SUBMISSION OF NEO DETECTIONS TO THE MPC  HELPING AVOID DUPLICATION OF OBSERVATIONS BY OTHER STATIONS. THE PIPELINE'S IMAGE SUBTRACTION ALGORITHM INCREASES DETECTION EFFICIENCY IN CROWDED FIELDS AND IN FIELDS WHERE STARS LEAVE LONG TRAILS DUE TO TRACKING ON A FAST TARGET'S MOTION. AUTOMATED DETECTION IS SUPPLEMENTED WHEN NECESSARY BY VISUAL CHECKING OF IMAGES AND MANUAL MEASUREMENT OF TARGET POSITIONS. A PROPOSED CAMERA UPGRADE FOR THE 0.81-M TELESCOPE IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE A 50-60% INCREASE IN THAT TELESCOPE'S PRODUCTIVITY. THE PROPOSED NEO OBSERVATION PROGRAM IS RELEVANT TO SUPPORT NASA-FUNDED NEO SURVEYS  ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE EXPECTED SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE NEO DISCOVERY RATES OF THE MAJOR SURVEYS (CSS AND PAN-STARRS) IN THE NEAR FUTURE.","","2018","$14,392","$0","$14,392","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Oregon", "","","","",""

"LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION","Lockheed Martin","United States","","","","","THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE SOLAR CORONA UNDERGOES CONTINUAL EVOLUTION DUE TO THE DYNAMICS OF THE UNDERLYING CHROMOSPHERIC ANDPHOTOSPHERIC MAGNETIC FIELD. THIS EVOLUTION IS OBSERVED TO TAKE MANY FORMS  RANGING FROM SLOW  GRADUAL ADJUSTMENTS TO MORE DYNAMIC SHIFTS EMBODIED BY FILAMENT ERUPTIONS  FLARES  AND CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS. BECAUSE THE MORPHOLOGIES OF THESE MORE ENERGETIC EVENTS ARE MOST LIKELY INFLUENCED BY THE MAGNETIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH SUCH ACTIVITY IS EMBEDDED  IT IS USEFUL TO STUDY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TOPOLOGY OF THE LARGE-SCALE CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD AND THE OCCURRENCE AND NON-OCCURRENCE OF ERUPTIVE EVENTS. INVESTIGATING THESE RELATIONSHIPS IS EXPECTED TO LEAD TO A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE CORONA EVOLVES AND THE CAPABILITY TO BETTER PREDICT THESE EVENTS. THE LOCATIONS OF TOPOLOGICAL NULL POINTS (WHERE ALL COMPONENTS OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD VANISH) AND SEPARATOR FIELD LINES THAT CONNECT THESE NULL POINTS ARE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST AS THEY ARE THEORIZED TO BE PREFERENTIAL LOCATIONS FOR THE RECONNECTION NEEDED FOR AN ERUPTION TO OCCUR.ADDITIONALLY  THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SOLAR WIND APPEAR TO BE DETERMINED (AT LEAST IN PART) BY THE LARGE-SCALE TOPOLOGY OF THE CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD. INDEED  THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN CLOSED FLUX AND FLUX THAT IS OPEN TO THE HELIOSPHERE IS A TOPOLOGICAL SEPARATRIX SURFACE. MAPPING SOLAR WIND STREAMS BACK TO THE PHOTOSPHERE  WITH THE AIM OF UNDERSTANDING  FOR EXAMPLE  IN SITU MEASUREMENTS OF WIND SPEED (I.E.  SLOW AND FAST WIND STREAMS)  FIELD STRENGTH  AND COMPOSITION  IS A COMMON ACTIVITY.WE ARE THUS PROPOSING HERE TO CREATE AND PUT ONLINE THE FIRST SEARCHABLE DATABASE OF TOPOLOGICAL FEATURES TO ENABLE SUCH RESEARCH  AND TO MAKE THIS DATABASE AVAILABLE TO THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY VIA THE SOLAR DATA ANALYSIS CENTER (SDAC) AT NASA  THE VIRTUAL SOLAR OBSERVATORY (VSO)  AND THE HELIOPHYSICS EVENTS KNOWLEDGEBASE (HEK). THESE FEATURES ARE DERIVED FROM LONG-RUNNING TIME SERIES OF BOTH POTENTIAL FIELD SOURCE SURFACE (PFSS) AND MAGNETOFRICTIONAL (MF) MODELS SPANNING THE PAST 20 YEARS. AS PART OF THIS PROJECT  WE ADDITIONALLY PROPOSE TO ENABLE THE ONLINE VISUALIZATION OF TOPOLOGICAL FEATURES BY MAKING ENHANCEMENTS TO AN EXISTING TOOL THAT IS CURRENTLY USED FOR CORONAL FIELD-LINE VISUALIZATION.

"ADNET SYSTEMS  INC.","","United States","","","","","THE TWITTER DATA SET IS  POTENTIALLY  A RICH SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR SCIENCE APPLICATIONS. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS  AS RESOURCES PERMIT  WE HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING THE FEASIBILITY OF EXTRACTING FROM THE TWITTER DATA STREAM--WITHOUT ACTIVELY SOLICITING INPUTS-- USEFUL INFORMATION FOR APPLICATION TO NASA PRECIPITATION RESEARCH. THERE HAVE BEEN SIMILAR USES OF TWITTER AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA  MOSTLY RELATED TO NATURAL HAZARDS MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT  IN WHICH THE PARTICIPANTS KNOWINGLY AND ACTIVELY CONTRIBUTE. TWO EXAMPLES ARE THE SNOWTWEETS PROJECT (HTTP://SNOWCORE.UWATERLOO.CA/SNOWTWEETS/) AND METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA IDENTIFICATION NEAR THE GROUND (MPING; HTTP://MPING.NSSL.NOAA.GOV/). OTHER SUCH USES DEAL WITH EARTHQUAKES  VOLCANOES  AIR POLLUTION  ETC. BOTH CASES OF PASSIVE AND ACTIVE ENGAGEMENTS BY PARTICIPATING CITIZEN SCIENTISTS HOLD POTENTIAL FOR  E.G.  AUGMENTING VALIDATION PROGRAMS OF NASA SATELLITE PRECIPITATION MISSIONS. IN THE PASSIVE CASE  WE HAVE EXPERIMENTED WITH LISTENING TO THE TWITTER STREAM FOR  RAIN  AND RELATED TWEETS  IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES  AND MAPPING THEIR RESULTING DISTRIBUTION. OUR APPROACH SEEMS PROMISING FOR DEMONSTRATING NOT ONLY A UNIQUE APPLICATION OF TWITTER BUT ALSO A DEEPER POWER RESIDING WITHIN THE TWITTER DATA SET. THE TIME-VARYING SET OF  RAIN  TWEETS  E.G.  CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS AN ORGANIC NETWORK OF RAIN GAUGES. ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO MORE FULLY ADDRESS INCLUDE (1) FILTERING FOR QUALITY TWEETS  (2) GEOLOCATION QUALITY  AND (3) IRREGULAR LOCATIONS OF TWEETS. IN THE ACTIVE CASE  WE HAVE CONDUCTED VERY PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS TO EVALUATE DIFFERENT METHODS OF ENGAGING WITH POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS. FOR EXAMPLE  WE HAVE REPLIED TO  RAIN  TWEETS WITH TRMM IMAGES GENERATED BY NASA GIOVANNI  CENTERED ON THE TWEET LOCATIONS. (FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE EXPERIMENT  OUR REPLIES ACTUALLY WERE DIRECTED TO A SPECIALLY CREATED TWITTER ACCOUNT OF OURS.) WE HAVE ALSO CONSIDERED USING ONLINE GAMES TO RECRUIT POTENTIAL ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS. WE BELIEVE OUR APPROACH  WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE PARTICIPANTS TO EXPLICITLY  SIGN UP  TO CONTRIBUTE AS CITIZEN SCIENTISTS  EVEN IN THE ACTIVE CASE  IS MORE ROBUST. PARTICIPANTS WHO ROUTINELY USE TWITTER WOULD CONTINUE TO DO SO. THE SCIENCE RATIONALE FOR MINING  RAIN  AND RELATED TWEETS IS TO POTENTIALLY OBTAIN A WIDESPREAD VIEW OF RAIN OCCURRENCE. ASSUMING THE TWEETS ARE OF REASONABLE QUALITY  THE TWO MAIN SCIENCE ISSUES ARE (1) THE RESULTS ARE MOSTLY ONLY QUALITATIVE (NO RAIN RATE INFORMATION) AND (2) THE RESULTS ARE ONLY POSITIVE (NO DIRECT NO-RAIN REPORTS)  THOUGH THERE ARE POSSIBLE WAYS TO MITIGATE THESE ISSUES. CURRENTLY  THE RAIN/NO-RAIN BOUNDARY IS SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY  WHEN GAUGE STATIONS OR SATELLITE OVERPASSES ARE SPARSE.  RAIN TWEETS  COULD HELP CONSTRAIN THIS BOUNDARY. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH AN APPLICATION OF TWITTER WOULD TAKE PLACE MAINLY IN THE U.S.  WHERE THERE IS A HIGH DENSITY OF DATA. ACTUAL APPLICATIONS WOULD BE MOSTLY OUTSIDE THE U.S.  BECAUSE  IN MANY OF THOSE REGIONS  THE RELEVANT MEASUREMENTS ARE FREQUENTLY SPARSE  INACCESSIBLE  OR NON-EXISTENT. OUR PROPOSED PROJECT GOAL IS TO MINE THE TWITTER DATABASE TO AUGMENT THE VALIDATION PROGRAM OF THE NASA GLOBAL PRECIPITATION MEASUREMENT (GPM) MISSION. OUR PROJECT WOULD ALSO HELP EXTEND THE APPLICATION REALM OF TWITTER  AS A PLATFORM FOR CITIZEN SCIENCE  TO SIMILAR SCIENCE MISSIONS IN GENERAL.

PORSEC HAS BEEN TO JAPAN  AUSTRALIA  CANADA  CHINA  INDIA  INDONESIA  CHILE  TAIWAN  AND KOREA. THE 2004 CONFERENCE WAS IN SOUTH AMERICA  AND PORSEC RETURNS THERE ON 3-11 NOVEMBER 2016. DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION HAS BEEN SET FOR JUNE 20TH  2016.  THE MAIN TOPIC FOR PORSEC IS REMOTE SENSING OF OCEANS BY SATELLITES  BUT OTHER PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY TOPICS AND REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES  USING SHORE  SHIP OR AIRCRAFT BASED SENSORS  ARE ALSO INCLUDED. PORSEC  AND OCEAN REMOTE SENSING GENERALLY  OCCUPY AN IMPORTANT POSITION AT A TIME WHEN CARBON EMISSIONS FROM HUMAN ACTIVITIES ARE CHANGING THE CLIMATE OF THE EARTH  INCLUDING THE OCEANS  AND GROWING HUMAN IMPACTS ARE AFFECTING THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. THE IPCC REPORTS THAT THE OCEANS ARE WARMING  SEA LEVEL IS RISING  OCEANS ARE BECOMING MORE ACIDIC AND ARCTIC SEA ICE IS MELTING. OTHER CHANGES  IN CIRCULATION  STRATIFICATION  PRECIPITATION AND STORMS HAVE BEEN NOTED AND UNEXPECTED POSITIVE FEEDBACKS CAN ALSO BE SERIOUS.  OCEAN SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING HAS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THESE FINDINGS. THE CONFERENCE WILL REVIEW AND DISCUSS THE STATE OF OCEAN REMOTE SENSING AND WILL HELP EARLY CAREER SCIENTISTS AND STUDENTS INVOLVED IN OCEAN-ATMOSPHERE STUDIES USING REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES TO BENEFIT FROM INTERACTIONS WITH THE EXPERTS PARTICIPATING FROM ALL OVER THE GLOBE. THE CONFERENCE WILL ALSO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOWCASE THE RESEARCH WORK CARRIED OUT USING REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES FROM VARIOUS SATELLITE MISSIONS AND THE APPLICATIONS OF OCEAN REMOTE SENSING FOR SOCIETAL BENEFITS.","","2018","$28,798","$0","$28,798","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Washington", "","","","",""

"NORTHWEST RESEARCH ASSOCIATES  INC.","","United States","","","","","THE ENERGY TO POWER SOLAR ENERGETIC EVENTS MUST ULTIMATELY ORIGINATE AT OR BELOW THE SOLAR PHOTOSPHERE  AND IS LIKELY TO BUILD UP IN THE CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD BEFORE RELEASE IN AN EVENT. IN ORDER TO FULLY UNDERSTAND FLARES AND CMES  IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY STORED IN THE CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD. ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES IN ESTIMATING THE CORONAL ENERGY IS THAT THE RESULTS CANNOT EASILY BE TESTED ON DATA FOR WHICH THE ANSWER IS KNOWN. HOWEVER  BY COMPARING THE FLUX INTO AND OUT OF THE CORONA WITH ESTIMATES OF THE ENERGY AT SPECIFIC TIMES OBTAINED FROM A VARIETY OF APPROACHES  WE CAN CONSTRAIN THE RESULTS OF THE METHODS. FOR EXAMPLE  IF THE FLUX INTO THE CORONA SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEEDS THE FLUX OUT OF THE CORONA OVER AN EXTENDED TIME INTERVAL  THEN EITHER THE INPUT FLUX IS BEING OVERESTIMATED  OR THE OUTPUT FLUX IS BEING UNDERESTIMATED. THE PROPOSED WORK ADDRESSES THE FIRST AND FOURTH HIGH LEVEL SCIENCE GOALS FROM THE HELIOPHYSICS DECADAL SURVEY  NAMELY  1. ""DETERMINE THE ORIGINS OF THE SUN'S ACTIVITY AND PREDICT THE VARIATIONS IN THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT"" AND  4. ""DISCOVER AND CHARACTERIZE FUNDAMENTAL PROCESSES THAT OCCUR BOTH WITHIN THE HELIOSPHERE AND THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE."" THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION WILL MODEL HOW THE ENERGY WHICH POWERS SOLAR ENERGETIC EVENTS IS STORED IN THE CORONA  AND MAY LEAD TO NEW TOOLS FOR PREDICTING THE VARIATIONS IN THE X-RAY FLUX IN THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT. INSOFAR AS OTHER STARS ALSO HAVE MAGNETIZED CORONAE  IT MAY CHARACTERIZE A PROCESS OCCURRING THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE. TO TRACK THE FLOW OF FREE ENERGY THROUGH THE PHOTOSPHERE  WE WILL USE DAVE4VM TO ESTIMATE THE PHOTOSPHERIC FLOWS  AND FROM THESE COMPUTE THE POYNTING FLUX INTO THE CORONA. TO ESTIMATE THE ENERGY IN THE CORONA AT A GIVEN TIME  WE WILL USE NONLINEAR FORCE-FREE FIELD (NLFFF) EXTRAPOLATIONS FROM INDIVIDUAL MAGNETOGRAMS. IN ADDITION  WE WILL MODEL THE EVOLUTION OF THE CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD USING A SEQUENCE OF MAGNETOGRAMS AS THE BOUNDARY CONDITION FOR AN MHD SIMULATION AND A TOPOLOGICAL METHOD; THE CORONAL ENERGY FROM THESE INDEPENDENT METHODS CAN BE EVALUATED AT THE SAME TIMES AS THE NLFFF EXTRAPOLATIONS. FINALLY  WE WILL ESTIMATE THE ENERGY LOST FROM THE CORONA. THE RADIATIVE AND CONDUCTIVE LOSSES  FOR EXAMPLE  CAN BE ESTIMATED BASED ON DOING A DIFFERENTIAL EMISSION MEASURE ANALYSIS TO EXTRACT CORONAL TEMPERATURE AND DENSITY ESTIMATES  AND USING THESE TO ESTIMATE RADIATIVE AND CONDUCTIVE LOSSES. FOR THIS INVESTIGATION  WE WILL CONSIDER A SMALL SAMPLE OF ACTIVE REGIONS  ON THE ORDER OF TEN  AND FOCUS ON REGIONS WHICH ARE NOT THE LARGEST AND MOST COMPLICATED  TO MAXIMIZE THE CHANCES OF SUCCESSFULLY MODELING THEM. WE WILL FOLLOW EACH REGION FOR AT LEAST A WEEK  TRACKING THE FLUX OF ENERGY INTO THE CORONA  AND THE ENERGY RELEASED FROM THE CORONA  AS WELL AS ESTIMATING THE ENERGY CONTENT OF THE CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD AT SPECIFIC TIMES. OUR INVESTIGATION WILL PRIMARILY UTILIZE DATA FROM NASA'S SOLAR DYNAMICS OBSERVATORY  BOTH SEQUENCES OF MAGNETOGRAMS FROM THE HELIOSEISMIC AND MAGNETIC IMAGER (HMI) AND CORONAL IMAGES FROM THE ATMOSPHERIC IMAGING ASSEMBLY (AIA). THESE WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED BY MAGNETOGRAMS FROM THE SOLAR OPTICAL TELESCOPE (SOT) ON THE JOINT JAXA/NASA HINODE MISSION  AND BY CORONAL IMAGES FROM HINODE'S X-RAY TELESCOPE (XRT).","","2018","$30,924","$0","$30,924","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Washington", "","","","",""
"SCIENCE SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS  INC.","SAIC","United States","","","","","THE CONTRIBUTION OF ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOLS TO THE EARTH S ENERGY BUDGET IS AN IMPORTANT  YET RELATIVELY UNCERTAIN  COMPONENT OF THE EARTH SYSTEM. STRATOSPHERIC AEROSOLS REPRESENT A LESS WELL-STUDIED  BUT NEVERTHELESS SIGNIFICANT  ELEMENT OF THIS CONTRIBUTION THROUGH THEIR IMPACT ON DIRECT RADIATIVE FORCING OF THE CLIMATE SYSTEM. COMPREHENSIVE MEASUREMENTS OF AEROSOL EXTINCTION VERTICAL PROFILES WITH DENSE SPATIAL SAMPLING ARE NEEDED TO BETTER CONSTRAIN CLIMATE MODEL SIMULATIONS OF AEROSOL EXTINCTION  COMPOSITION  AND PARTICLE SIZE  IN ORDER TO COMPUTE CLIMATE IMPACTS. THE MOST EFFECTIVE SOURCE OF STRATOSPHERIC AEROSOL EXTINCTION DATA COMES FROM SATELLITE LIMB SCATTERING MEASUREMENTS  WHICH PROVIDE GREATER SENSITIVITY THAN SPACE-BASED LIDAR AND MUCH BETTER SPATIAL SAMPLING THAN OCCULTATION MEASUREMENTS. THE OZONE MAPPING AND PROFILING SUITE (OMPS) LIMB PROFILER (LP)  CURRENTLY FLYING ON THE SUOMI NATIONAL POLARORBITING PARTNERSHIP (S-NPP) SATELLITE  HAS BEEN PROVIDING DAILY AEROSOL EXTINCTION PROFILE DATA FROM LIMB SCATTERING MEASUREMENTS SINCE APRIL 2012. WHILE THE S-NPP OMPS LP INSTRUMENT WAS DESIGNED FOR A 7-YEAR OPERATING LIFETIME  THE NEXT OMPS LP INSTRUMENT IS NOT SCHEDULED TO FLY UNTIL 2022. THIS RAISES THE POSSIBILITY OF A DATA GAP IN THIS CRUCIAL MEASUREMENT. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT  CALLED GLOBAL AEROSOL MONITORING SYSTEM (GAMS)  TO SUPPLEMENT THE OMPS LP MEASUREMENTS. OUR DESIGN USES MULTIPLE VIEWING DIRECTIONS TO IMPROVE SPATIAL SAMPLING AND PROVIDE MORE BALANCED MEASUREMENT SENSITIVITY THROUGHOUT THE ORBIT COMPARED TO OMPS LP. WAVELENGTH SELECTION IN THIS DESIGN IS LIMITED TO SIMPLE FILTERS (675 NM FOR AEROSOL SCIENCE  350 NM FOR ALTITUDE REGISTRATION) TO ENABLE A COMPACT INSTRUMENT SUITABLE FOR CUBESAT DEPLOYMENT. THIS PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED WITH NASA GSFC INTERNAL FUNDING  AND CURRENTLY MEETS TRL 2 CRITERIA. THIS PROPOSAL TO THE INSTRUMENT/MEASUREMENT CONCEPT DEMONSTRATION SUBELEMENT OF THE INSTRUMENT INCUBATOR PROGRAM (IIP-ICD) DESCRIBES OUR PLANS TO IMPROVE THE GAMS DESIGN TO PRODUCE A MORE SCIENTIFICALLY CAPABLE AND FLIGHT-READY INSTRUMENT (MULTI-ANGLE STRATOSPHERIC RADIOMETER  MASTAR). THE MASTAR CONCEPT WAS FORMALLY SUBMITTED TO THE 2017 DECADAL SURVEY FOR EARTH SCIENCE SECOND REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IN MAY 2016. ADDING A SECOND CHANNEL AT 1020 NM FOR SCIENCE MEASUREMENTS WILL IMPROVE AEROSOL DETECTION CAPABILITIES AT LOW ALTITUDES  HELP DETERMINE AEROSOL PARTICLE SIZE PROPERTIES  AND INCREASE CONTINUITY WITH HERITAGE DATA SETS. OPTICAL DESIGN STUDIES WILL BE PERFORMED TO OPTIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE OF MASTAR AND QUANTIFY STRAY LIGHT BEHAVIOR. WE WILL ALSO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF INCORPORATING ONBOARD DATA PROCESSING CAPABILITIES TO SATISFY THE SCIENCE OBJECTIVES. THE GOAL OF THIS EFFORT IS TO HAVE A LABORATORY TESTED MASTAR INSTRUMENT AT TRL 4 BY THE END OF THE IIP AWARD PERIOD.

"BIOSPHERICAL INSTRUMENTS  INC.","","United States","","","","","NEW AIRBORNE INSTRUMENT CAPABILITIES  INCLUDING THE NASA COASTAL AND OCEAN AIRBORNE SCIENCE TESTBED  (COAST  PI:GUILD) AND OCEAN COLOR ECOSYSTEMS ASSESSMENT WITH NOVEL INSTRUMENTS AND AIRCRAFT (OCEANIA  PI:GUILD)  ARE  ADVANCING TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT TO ADDRESS MEASUREMENT CHALLENGES OF THE OPTICALLY COMPLEX COASTAL  ZONE AND INLAND WATERS WHILE MAINTAINING OPEN- OCEAN COMPETENCIES. THE NASA AMES COASTAL AIRBORNE INSTRUMENT RADIOMETERS (C-AIR)  A NEW AIRBORNE  BIO-OPTICAL MICRORADIOMETER INSTRUMENT PACKAGE  WAS FLOWN FOR COAST (NASA HOPE) IN 2011 AND OCEANIA  (NASA AMES SIF) IN 2013 OVER MONTEREY BAY  CA. C-AIR USES 19 HIGHLY-ACCURATE MICRORADIOMETERS TO PROVIDE AN UNPRECEDENTED DYNAMIC RANGE (10  DECADES) FOR REMOTE SENSING OF APPARENT OPTICAL PROPERTIES (AOPS). THE SENSORS HAVE A HIGH DATA  RATE (GREATER THAN 15 HZ) AND DO NOT SATURATE WHEN VIEWING THE  SUN OR SUN GLINT. A 2015 NASA AMES  SIF AWARD IS ADDING THE NASA GODDARD COMPACT-AIRBORNE ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOMETERS FOR OCEANOGRAPHY  (C-AERO) AND AN ENHANCED SPECTRAL RANGE (19 CHANNELS EACH SPANNING 320-1 640 NM) FOR C-AIR TO MATCH  C-AERO. THE COMBINATION ALLOWS COUPLED OCEAN-ATMOSPHERIC STUDIES AND AN IMPROVEMENT OF ATMOSPHERIC  CORRECTION SCHEMES EMPHASIZING LONG WAVELENGTHS. C-AIR AND C-AERO HAVE 19 MICRORADIOMETER CHANNELS  THAT MATCH LEGACY AND NEXT-GENERATION SATELLITES USED IN ALGORITHMS TO PRODUCE OCEAN COLOR PRODUCTS  AND SUPPORTING WATER QUALITY RESEARCH  TOOLS TO ASSESS PHYTOPLANKTON (AND HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOM)  SPECIES COMPOSITION  AND SHALLOW WATER COMMUNITY COMPOSITION ASSESSMENT. BOTH INSTRUMENTS HAVE  UNPRECEDENTED SIGNAL TO NOISE AND PROVIDE HIGH FIDELITY AOP MEASUREMENTS AT THE LAND-OCEAN BOUNDARY  INCLUDING  RADIOMETRICALLY SHALLOW AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS  ACROSS A HERETOFORE RARELY ACHIEVED SPECTRAL RANGE (UV  TO SWIR). THESE ATTRIBUTES ARE CRITICAL FOR ANSWERING SCIENCE QUESTIONS IN DYNAMIC COASTAL WATERS  AND SUPPORTING NEXT GENERATION COUPLED OCEAN-ATMOSPHERIC SATELLITE MISSIONS RELEVANT TO NASA'S  CARBON CYCLE AND ECOSYSTEMS EARTH SCIENCE FOCUS AREA. FURTHER  THIS AIRBORNE CAPABILITY SUPPORTS  THE WATER AND ENERGY CYCLE  CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND CHANGE  AND ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION FOCUS  AREAS. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS TO MATURE AN AIRBORNE CALIBRATION  VALIDATION  AND  RESEARCH (CVR) CAPABILITY FOR PRESENT AND NEXT-GENERATION COASTAL AND OCEAN BIOLOGY BIO-OPTICAL  MEASUREMENTS USING EXISTING AIRBORNE RADIOMETERS DEVELOPED WITH NASA FUNDING THAT IS BEING  COMMERCIALIZED FOR THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE. BECAUSE THE RADIANCE INSTRUMENTS CAN BE  POINTED AT ANY NATURAL TARGET WITH EQUAL EFFICACY  THE RADIOMETERS CAN PROVIDE HIGH-QUALITY CVR DATA FOR COUPLED  ATMOSPHERIC-OCEANIC MISSIONS (E.G.  PACE  GEOCAPE  AND HYSPIRI) AND SUPPORTING CVR FIELD ACTIVITIES  (E.G.  HARPOONS  EXPORTS  AND ARTICCOLORS). THE C- AIR AND C-AERO RADIANCE PAIRS ALLOW THE  SIMULTANEOUS MEASUREMENTS OF THE SUN AND SKY  PLUS THE SEA SURFACE AT TWO DIFFERENT ANGLES  WITH  THE LATTER SLANT PATHS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL ATMOSPHERIC ATTENUATION CHARACTERIZATIONS. THE SPECIFIC  OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE TO SUPPORT THE FOLLOWING ENGINEERING ACTIVITIES TO ADVANCE THE COMBINED C-AIR AND C-AERO  INSTRUMENT SUITE:  DESIGN AND CERTIFY THE HARDWARE FOR C-AIR AND C-AERO TO BE INTEGRATED FOR A  VARIETY OF AIRCRAFT  AND TO BE CAMPAIGN READY TO RESPOND TO COASTAL   EVENTS;  IMPLEMENT THERMAL  RESPONSE ANALYSES FOR THE 19-MICRORADIOMETER C-AERO ARRAYS AND ESTIMATE THE IMPROVED ACCURACY WITH COMPARISONS TO C-AIR;  IMPLEMENT A FIELD-COMMISSIONED SUN-TRACKING CAPABILITY FOR  MEASUREMENTS SUPPORTING ATMOSPHERIC CHARACTERIZATION AND CORRECTION;  INCREASE THE C-AERO DATA  ACQUISITION RATE TO 25HZ;  IMPROVE SPATIAL ACCURACY FOR WATER-LEAVING RADIANCE BY REDUCING TIMING  AND POINTING UNCERTAINTIES;  REDESIGN THE AIRCRAFT-INSTRUMENT INTERFACE MOUNT TO ALLOW STATIC OR  POSSIBLY DYNAMIC RESPONSES TO CHANGES IN AIRCRAFT PITCH BIAS; AND SOFTWARE PROCESS FLOW FOR  END-TO-END DATA ACQUISITION","","2018","$41,831","$0","$41,831","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","California", "","","","",""

THE SATELLITE DATA WILL BE DERIVED FROM A VARIETY OF POLAR ORBITING SATELLITES FROM NASA  NOAA AND THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY (ESA). THE AMOUNT OF RAIN  SUBSEQUENT FLOODING AND RUNOFF INTO THE OCEAN FROM HURRICANE HARVEY IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN DUE TO ITS IMPACTS ON THE FAUNA AND FLORA OF THE COASTAL OCEAN. NOT ONLY IS FRESHWATER INPUT WITH ITS TURBIDITY AND INCREASED CHLOROPHYLL + COLORIZED DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER (CDOM) OF CONCERN  BUT THE INDUSTRIAL AND DOMESTIC HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS CAUSING POLLUTION IN THE WATER ARE OF CONCERN AS WELL (TABUCHI  2017). TROPICAL STORMS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO CAUSE SIGNIFICANT SHORT-TERM BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS BY REDISTRIBUTING SPECIES OR FORCING THEM TO MIGRATE AND LONGER-TERM EFFECTS SUCH AS SMOTHERING OYSTER BEDS  REDUCING THE RECOVERY RATE OF CORALS  AND CHANGING THE RECRUITMENT SUCCESS FROM EGGS TO JUVENILES. HOWEVER  LONGER-TERM EFFECTS ARE NOT WELL STUDIED AND THUS  IN LIGHT OF THIS MAJOR  CATEGORY 5 STORM  THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR THE PROPOSED WORK. FISHERIES MANAGERS NEED TO KNOW IMMEDIATELY THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL EXTENT OF THE PLUME WHICH WILL ASSIST THEM TO EVALUATE WHICH STOCKS ARE LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED AND WHAT MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES NEED TO BE MODIFIED IN LIGHT OF THIS DISTURBANCE. THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH IS OF HIGH SIGNIFICANCE AND LIKELY TO HAVE A LONG-LASTING IMPACT DUE TO THE INCREASED UNDERSTANDING OF SUCH EVENTS ON THE SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM IMPACTS OF TROPICAL EVENTS ON THE FAUNA AND FLORA IN THE NORTHWEST GULF OF MEXICO  ALONG WITH THE TRANSPORT AND FATE OF THE POLLUTED WATER OFFSHORE. THE BENEFICIAL IMPACTS TO FISHERIES MANAGERS IS THAT THE DERIVED ENVIRONMENTAL DATA WILL BE USED FOR STOCK ASSESSMENTS WHICH IS MANDATED BY THE MAGNUSON STEVENS FISHERIES MANAGEMENT ACT IN ECOSYSTEM BASED FISHERIES MANAGEMENT. INCORPORATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS WILL RESULT IN IMPROVED STOCK ASSESSMENTS AND FISHERIES MANAGEMENT. THIS PROJECT WILL MAP THE IMPACT OF SUCH MAJOR TROPICAL STORMS ON THE DISTRIBUTION AND CONCENTRATION OF TERRESTRIAL AND OCEAN CARBON FLUXES BY TRACKING THE OCEAN COLOR CHLOROPHYLL SIGNAL IN THE NORTHWEST GULF OF MEXICO  WHICH IS CRITICAL IN UNDERSTANDING THE CARBON CYCLE THROUGH THE OCEAN ECOSYSTEM AND BACK TO THE ATMOSPHERE.

"TETHERS UNLIMITED  INC.","","United States","","","","","THE BI-SAT OBSERVATIONS OF THE LUNAR ATMOSPHERE ABOVE SWIRLS (BOLAS) CONCEPT IS FOR A TETHERED  CUBESAT MISSION CAPABLE OF MAKING REPEATED MEASUREMENTS AT LOW ALTITUDES ABOVE THE MOON REQUIRED IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND VITAL  ASPECTS OF THE LUNAR HYDROGEN CYCLE AND SPACE WEATHERING.  OBTAINING OBSERVATIONS CLOSE TO THE LUNAR SURFACE IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF  ""MASCONS""  WHICH MAKE ORBITING AT LOW ALTITUDES VERY UNSTABLE. AT PRESENT  ACQUIRING REPEATED  MEASUREMENTS FROM VERY LOW ALTITUDES REQUIRES A LARGE SPACECRAFT WITH THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF  FUEL (MASS) NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN ITS ORBIT. THE MOST GROUND-BREAKING ASPECT OF THE BOLAS CONCEPT  IS THE USE OF TWO CUBESATS CONNECTED BY A TETHER MANY TENS OF KILOMETERS IN LENGTH  WHICH CAN BE  USED TO MAKE SIMULTANEOUS HIGH AND LOW ALTITUDE MEASUREMENTS ABOVE THE SAME LOCATION ON THE MOON.  CRUCIALLY  THE CENTER-OF-MASS OF THE TETHERED SPACECRAFT IS AT AN ALTITUDE WHERE   THE ORBIT IS  RELATIVELY STABLE AND SIGNIFICANTLY LESS PROPULSIVE MANEUVERING IS REQUIRED. THIS INNOVATION WILL  ENABLE SMALLSAT MISSIONS TO MAKE IN SITU AND REMOTE SENSING MEASUREMENTS FROM LOW ALTITUDES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO ADDRESSING  MANY COMPELLING QUESTIONS IN PLANETARY SCIENCE.  THE BOLAS MISSION WILL FOCUS ON INVESTIGATING THE HYDROGEN CYCLE AND SPACE WEATHERING AT THE MOON   BY DETERMINING: (I) THE MECHANISMS AND DYNAMICS OF LUNAR HYDROGEN IMPLANTATION  AND THEIR  DEPENDENCE ON SURFACE COMPOSITION  REGOLITH PROPERTIES  LOCAL TOPOGRAPHY  PLASMA CONDITIONS   TIME-OF-DAY  AND CRUSTAL MAGNETIC FIELDS; AND (II) HOW THIS RELATES TO THE FORMATION OF LUNAR  ""SWIRLS""  SPACE WEATHERING PROCESSES AND THE EVOLUTION OF AIRLESS BODIES. THESE SCIENCE OBJECTIVES  ARE EXTREMELY TIMELY AND HIGHLY RELEVANT TO THE 2014 NASA SCIENCE PLAN  IN PARTICULAR TO THE  QUESTION OF HOW THE SOLAR SYSTEM HAS FORMED AND EVOLVED  AND WILL PRODUCE HIGH IMPACT SCIENCE.  FOR THE NECESSARY NEUTRALS  FIELDS AND PLASMA MEASUREMENTS  THE PRELIMINARY SCIENCE PAYLOAD  CONSISTS OF AN ION SPECTROMETER  ENERGETIC NEUTRAL ATOM IMAGER  PLASMA WAVE SYSTEM  AND  MAGNETOMETER. SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN INVESTED IN MINIATURIZING   THESE  INSTRUMENTS FOR A CUBESAT PLATFORM. THE INSTRUMENTS WILL BE MOUNTED ON BOTH OF THE TETHERED  CUBESATS IN ORDER THAT HIGH AND LOW ALTITUDE MEASUREMENTS CAN BE COMPARED. THIS WOULD BE ESPECIALLY  IMPORTANT WHEN FLYING ABOVE A CRUSTAL MAGNETIC FIELD  AS IT   WOULD PROVIDE CRUCIAL MEASUREMENTS  RELATING TO THE FORCING FROM THE INCOMING SOLAR WIND AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PLASMA  FIELDS  AND  NEUTRALS WITHIN THE ""MINI-MAGNETOSPHERE"". THIS WOULD THEN BE USED TO UNDERSTAND THE HYDROXYLATION   HYDRATION AND SPACE WEATHERING PROCESSES IN THESE REGIONS AND THEIR ROLE IN FORMING THE ENIGMATIC  ""SWIRL"" PATTERNS ON THE LUNAR SURFACE.  THE BOLAS CONCEPT STUDY TEAM CONSISTS OF A SMALL  EXPERT LUNAR SCIENCE AND INSTRUMENTATION TEAM AT  GSFC; SPECIALISTS IN DESIGNING  INTEGRATING AND BUILDING CUBESATS AT MOREHEAD STATE UNIVERSITY  (MSU); EXPERTS IN CUBESAT PROPULSION SYSTEMS AT BUSEK CO. INC.; PIONEERS IN SPACE TETHER SYSTEMS AT  TETHERS UNLIMITED  INC.; AS WELL AS WORLD CLASS GSFC ENGINEERS TO PROVIDE THERMAL MANAGEMENT   ATTITUDE DETERMINATION AND CONTROL  AND FLIGHT DYNAMICS SOLUTIONS.  A MAJOR TASK IN THE CONCEPT STUDY WILL BE ADDRESSING THE FEASIBILITY AND LIMITATIONS OF A TETHERED  SMALLSAT  SUCH AS TETHER DEPLOYMENT (RETRACTION)  STABILITY (ORBITAL CONFIGURATIONS)  LIFETIME   ALTITUDE RANGE  AND ABILITY TO TARGET REGIONS-OF-INTEREST. THIS WILL INVOLVE TRADES BETWEEN TETHER  LENGTH  MASS  AND DEPLOY-ABILITY  AS WELL AS SPACECRAFT SIZE  CONFIGURATION AND SCIENCE CAPABILITY.  THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BOLAS CONCEPT PROMISES TO SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF SMALLSAT MISSIONS TO ACHIEVE CUTTING  EDGE PLANETARY SCIENCE.","","2018","$49,371","$0","$49,371","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Washington", "","","","",""

HOWEVER  THE ACCURACY OF NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS OVER ANTARCTICA AND GREENLAND WHERE THERE IS A VERY SPARSE NETWORK OF GROUND STATIONS  IS NOT WELL KNOWN. THEREFORE  THE ACCURACY OF THE PATH DELAY COMPUTATION OVER THESE REGIONS IS NOT KNOWN. THE ESSENCE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO USE GPS RADIO OCCULTATION DATA FOR COMPARISON OF OBSERVED PATH DELAYS FROM THESE OBSERVATIONS WITH PREDICTED PATH DELAYS FROM THE NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS THAT ARE USED FOR PROCESSING ICESAT DATA. THE DIFFERENCES WILL BE USED FOR DERIVING THE ERROR MODEL OF ATMOSPHERIC PATH DELAY CORRECTIONS OF ALTIMETRY DATA OVER ANTARCTICA AND GREENLAND. SINCE THERE ARE TOO FEW METEOROLOGICAL STATIONS IN THE INNER PARTS OF ANTARCTICA AND GREENLAND  THE GPS RADIO OCCULTATIONS WILL BE USED AS THE GROUND TRUTH. THE NEAR TERM GOAL IS TO EVALUATE THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE STATE OF THE ATMOSPHERE TO ESTIMATES OF ICE MASS LOSS IN ANTARCTICA AND GREENLAND AND ITS SEASONAL VARIATIONS. IN PARTICULAR  WE WILL EVALUATE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS IN PATH DELAY  SEASONAL VARIATIONS  AND THE SECULAR TREND. SEASONAL ERRORS MAY CAUSE BIASES IN ESTIMATES OF ICE MASS BALANCE DERIVED FROM SATELLITE ALTIMETRY. AS A LONG TERM GOAL  WE WILL EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING RADIO OCCULTATION DATA NOT ONLY FOR THE CHARACTERIZATION OF PATH DELAY ERRORS  BUT FOR AN IMPROVEMENT IN COMPUTATION OF PATH DELAY FOR PROCESSING ICESAT-2 DATA. WE WILL DERIVE AN EMPIRICAL MODEL OF BIASES IN PATH DELAYS AND EVALUATE WHETHER THE BIAS CORRECTION MERITS PROCESSING ICESAT-2 DATA OVER ANTARCTICA AND GREENLAND. IN A CASE IF THE EVIDENCE WILL BE COLLECTED IN FAVOR OF THIS MODEL  THE EXPERIENCE GAINED IN PROCESSING RO DATA WILL HELP TO FORMULATE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MODIFICATION OF THE DATA ANALYSIS PROCEDURE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL ISSUES OF LOGISTICS.","","2018","$53,011","$0","$53,011","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Maryland", "","","","",""

"NORTHROP GRUMMAN SYSTEMS CORPORATION","Northrop Grumman","United States","","","","","NORTHROP GRUMMAN AEROSPACE SYSTEMS (NGAS) PROPOSES TO BUILD AND DEMONSTRATE AN INTEGRATED PHOTONIC IMAGING INSTRUMENT  WHICH PROMISES TO REVOLUTIONIZE SPECTRAL SENSING AND OFFERS A COST EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE PATH TO FUTURE LAND IMAGING NEEDS AND ARCHITECTURES. THE LANDSAT PROGRAM HAS PROVIDED CRITICAL SENSING OF OUR EARTH FOR OVER 40 YEARS  DELIVERING ESSENTIAL PRODUCTS AND UNDERSTANDING OF CHANGING LAND USE TO SCIENTISTS AND USERS AROUND THE WORLD. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE CONTINUE AND EXTEND THESE MEASUREMENTS WITH A SYSTEM THAT IS AFFORDABLE AND RESILIENT FOR FUTURE EARTH IMAGING NEEDS. HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING (HSI) PROMISES ACCESS TO NEW LAND ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES AND DATA PRODUCTS THROUGH THE MEASUREMENT OF IMAGE SCENES AT HIGH SPECTRAL RESOLUTION WHILE MAINTAINING CRITICAL CONTINUITY WITH TRADITIONAL LANDSAT DATA PRODUCTS.  THROUGH OUR WORK ON THE SUSTAINABLE LAND IMAGING (SLI) REDUCED INSTRUMENT ENVELOPE STUDY AND THE ESTO NOVEL CONCEPTS FOR SLI STUDY  NGAS HAS DEMONSTRATED A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF SLI MISSION  INSTRUMENT AND CALIBRATION REQUIREMENTS  AND WE HAVE SHOWN THAT A VERSATILE HSI INSTRUMENT CAN MEET SLI INSTRUMENT GOALS. TO ADVANCE PHOTONIC IMAGING TECHNOLOGY  NGAS HAS DEVELOPED PROOF-OF-CONCEPT WAVEGUIDE FILTERS AND DETECTORS IN THE SHORTWAVE INFRARED (SWIR) RANGE ON IR&D. UNDER THE BLACK DIAMOND PROGRAM WE ARE IMPLEMENTING FIRST LEVEL INTEGRATION TECHNOLOGY FOR MATING THE WAVEGUIDE FILTERS WITH PHOTODETECTORS. WE WILL LEVERAGE THESE DEVELOPMENTS TO BUILD A PROTOTYPE SLI-T INSTRUMENT THAT REPRESENTS A REVOLUTIONARY STEP FOR LAND IMAGING.  OUR OBJECTIVES FOR THE SLI-T ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATIONS PROGRAM ARE TO BUILD AND TEST A NEXT-GENERATION  HETEROGENEOUSLY INTEGRATED PHOTONIC INSTRUMENT COVERING TWO SLI BANDS 9 (1.36   1.39  M  3NM RESOLUTION ) AND 6 (1.56  1.66  M  6NM RESOLUTION). TO MAXIMALLY USE EXISTING DESIGNS FOR RAPID PROGRESS  WE ARE EXECUTING THE PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT ON SWIR WAVELENGTHS. THE PHOTONIC/ELECTRONIC DESIGN  MANUFACTURE  INTEGRATION  AND TEST PROCESSES DEVELOPED FOR THE SWIR ARE DIRECTLY SCALABLE TO THE 0.4  1.0  M VISIBLE NEAR-INFRARED WAVELENGTH RANGE. THE BENEFITS OF USING LITHOGRAPHICALLY PATTERNED PHOTONIC WAVEGUIDE TECHNOLOGY ARE A TOTAL INSTRUMENT MASS AND VOLUME REDUCTION OF ~7X AND ~25X RESPECTIVELY COMPARED TO THE CURRENT MSI APPROACH. IT ENABLES IMAGE ACQUISITION IN SPECTRAL BANDS AND MODES NOT POSSIBLE WITH CURRENT LAND IMAGING INSTRUMENTS BRINGING NEW LAND PRODUCTS TO USERS FROM AN EXTREMELY COMPACT  SCALABLE INSTRUMENT.  OUR PROPOSED SLI-T EFFORT STARTS WITH OUR EXISTING PHOTONIC DESIGNS. WE WILL OPTIMIZE WAVEGUIDE GEOMETRY  DEVELOP THE DETECTOR LAYER AND FABRICATE THE WAVEGUIDES AND DETECTORS. WE WILL IMPLEMENT WAVEGUIDE/DETECTOR INTEGRATION USING OUR DIVERSE ACCESSIBLE HETEROGENEOUS INTEGRATION PROCESS DEVELOPED IN OUR MICROELECTRONICS FOUNDRY. WE WILL ALSO DEVELOP A HIGH-PERFORMANCE CMOS READ-OUT INTEGRATED CIRCUIT (ROIC) CUSTOMIZED FOR INTEGRATION WITH THE WAVEGUIDE AND DETECTOR LAYERS. WE WILL DEMONSTRATE THE INTEGRATION OF MULTIPLE WAVEGUIDE/DETECTOR/ROIC LAYERS INTO A PHOTONIC HSI INSTRUMENT FOR SLI SWIR WAVELENGTH RANGES. THESE LAYERS WILL BE THINNED TO ENABLE STACKING INTO A COMPACT AND MONOLITHIC STRUCTURE. THE INTEGRATED SLI-T INSTRUMENT WILL BE TESTED IN A RELEVANT ENVIRONMENT. NGAS PROPOSES A ONE YEAR PROGRAM WITH OPTIONS FOR YEARS 2-5 TO MATURE THE INSTRUMENT FROM AN ENTRY TRL 3 TO AN EXIT TRL 6 WITH DEFINED YEARLY MILESTONES.  OUR INTEGRATED PHOTONIC/MICROELECTRONIC MANUFACTURING USES STANDARDIZED  REPEATABLE PROCESSES. ULTIMATELY  THESE DEVICES WILL BE RAPIDLY AND INEXPENSIVELY PATTERNED AND REPRODUCED IN LARGE QUANTITIES ENABLING HYPERSPECTRAL DATA ACQUISITION IN MINIATURE PACKAGES AND MODES NOT POSSIBLE WITH CURRENT INSTRUMENTS. SUCH A CAPABILITY OPENS THE FIELD OF IMAGING SPECTROMETRY FROM TRADITIONAL REMOTE SENSING TO LOW COST COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS INCLUDING AGRICULTURE  MANUFACTURING  BIOMEDICINE AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS.","","2018","$54,107","$0","$54,107","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","California", "Virginia","USA","publicly traded","aerospace and military contracting","aerospace & military contracting"
"ALASKA ECOSCIENCE","","United States","","","","","WATER IS KEY TO ALL ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS  INCLUDING THE CARBON  CYCLE. ADDITIONALLY  RATES OF C BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSING ARE COMMONLY MUCH GREATER IN INLAND WATERS THAN TERRESTRIAL LANDSCAPES  AS THEY COLLECTIVELY STORE C IN SEDIMENTS  EXPORT C TO OCEANS  AND EMIT CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) AND METHANE (CH4) TO THE ATMOSPHERE. TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS ARE A DOMINANT SOURCE OF C TO INLAND WATERS THROUGH SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE NETWORKS. THESE NETWORKS ARE CHANGING ACROSS BOREAL AND ARCTIC REGIONS  AS PERMAFROST THAW  CLIMATE WARMING  AND FIRE CREATE NEW CONDUITS FOR WATER MOVEMENT  CHANGE VEGETATIVE WATER USE AND EVAPOTRANSPIRATION  AND ALTER THE DISTRIBUTION OF WATER ON THE LANDSCAPE. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS OF THESE CHANGES IN THE WATER CYCLE IF WE ARE TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCURATELY PROJECT THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE WARMING AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS ON CIRCUMBOREAL AND ARCTIC ECOSYSTEMS.WE PROPOSE AN INTEGRATED INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH CAMPAIGN TO EVALUATE THE VULNERABILITY OF BOREAL LANDSCAPES TO CHANGE IN THE ""PLUMBING"" THAT CONTROLS WATER MOVEMENT AND DISTRIBUTION  CHANGE IN THE SOURCE AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF C DELIVERED TO INLAND WATERS  AND CHANGE IN THE RATES AND PROCESSES THAT CONTROL ORGANIC AND INORGANIC C PROCESSING BY INLAND WATERS AND THEIR EMISSIONS OF CO2 AND CH4 TO THE ATMOSPHERE. OUR APPROACH RECOGNIZES THAT PERMAFROST THAW WILL NOT ONLY ENHANCE GROUNDWATER FLOW AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUBSURFACE CONNECTIVITY  BUT THAT LOSS OF SUBSURFACE ICE WILL ALSO CHANGE THE STRUCTURE OF THE LAND SURFACE  CREATING THERMOKARST FEATURES IN SOME AREAS AND INITIATING LAKE LOSS OR LAKE CREATION IN OTHERS. IT ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT TERRESTRIAL SOURCES OF C TO INLAND WATERS WILL CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO THAW  FIRE AND OTHER DRIVERS OF CHANGE. THESE CONDITIONS WILL BE EVALUATED BY GEOPHYSICAL AND ECOSYSTEM SURVEYS WITH THE GOAL OF EXTRAPOLATION ACROSS THE BOREAL ABOVE DOMAIN THROUGH REMOTE SENSING ANALYSIS AND MAPPING.GEOPHYSICAL SUBSURFACE PERMAFROST CHARACTERIZATION VIA NEW GROUND AND EXISTING AIRBORNE SURVEYS WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY FRAMEWORK FOR HYDROLOGIC FIELD AND MODELING EFFORTS TO EVALUATE AND PROJECT THE EFFECTS OF CHANGE IN LATERAL CONNECTIVITY ON SURFACE WATER FLOW  GROUNDWATER FLOW  AND LAKE DISTRIBUTION. PERMAFROST THAW ENHANCES GROUNDWATER FLOW  CHANGES THE SEASONAL DISTRIBUTION OF STREAMFLOW  AND ALTERS LAKE BUDGETS. HOWEVER  THE DYNAMICS THAT CONTROL THESE CHANGES ARE NOT COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD  AND CRITICAL BASELINE INFORMATION ON SUBSURFACE PERMAFROST DISTRIBUTION IS TYPICALLY LACKING. USING NEWLY DEVELOPED CAPABILITIES FOR COLD REGIONS  OUR PROPOSED FIELD AND MODELING APPROACHES WILL HELP TO FILL THESE GAPS IN HYDROLOGIC UNDERSTANDING AND WILL ALSO INFORM ON THE ROUTING OF TERRESTRIAL C BY FLOW SYSTEMS TO INLAND WATERS AND THE RESIDENCE TIME OF C IN THOSE SYSTEMS.SOURCE  ROUTING  AND RESIDENCE TIME ARE IMPERATIVE TO UNDERSTANDING C DYNAMICS IN INLAND WATERS. WE WILL DETERMINE C SOURCE AND AGE THROUGH ANALYSES OF THE 14C CONTENT OF INORGANIC AND ORGANIC C SPECIES AND C-GAS EMISSIONS. MOLECULAR BIOMARKERS  COUPLED WITH MEASURED OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF DOC WILL INFORM ON TERRESTRIAL VERSUS AUTOCHTHONOUS SOURCES OF AQUATIC C AND ON ITS POTENTIAL FOR MINERALIZATION BY BIOLOGICAL OR PHOTO- DEGRADATION. MUCH OF TERRESTRIALLY-DERIVED AQUATIC C IS DEGRADED BEFORE REACHING SURFACE WATERS  SO HYDROLOGIC MODELING OF RESIDENCE TIMES WILL IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE AND WHEN INLAND WATER C-GAS EMISSIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE GREATEST. RADIOCARBON AGE OF AQUATIC C WILL FURTHER DELINEATE SOURCE AND INFORM ON IF AND WHERE C DERIVED FROM PERMAFROST OR ANCIENT SOIL SOURCES ARE DELIVERED TO INLAND WATERS. FINALLY  OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF WATER INDICATIVE OF DOC CONCENTRATION AND COMPOSITION WILL BE RELATED TO REMOTELY SENSED LAKE COLOR AND TO THE POTENTIAL FOR C-G S EMISSION  WITH THE GOAL OF EXTRAPOLATING INLAND WATER DOC COMPOSITION AND CO2 AND CH4 EMISSIONS ACROSS THE ABOVE DOMAIN.","","2018","$54,415","$0","$54,415","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Alaska", "","","","",""

OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESSES AT THE LAND-SEA INTERFACE IN THE ARCTIC SEA  HOWEVER  IS RELATIVELY POOR  PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF OBSERVATIONS AT SUITABLE SPATIO-TEMPORAL SCALES (CONSIDERING PRESENCE OF CLOUDS). IN ADDITION  THE OCCURRENCE OF ICE-EDGE AND UNDER-ICE BLOOM HAS RECENTLY DRAWN ATTENTION AND IS DEEMED TO RELATE TO THINNING OF ICE AND INCREASED SOLAR RADIATION REACHING WATER COLUMN. THE OCEAN COLOR REMOTE SENSING IS AN EFFECTIVE MEANS FOR MONITORING ECOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES IN THE ARCTIC OCEAN IN THIS RAPIDLY CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. HOWEVER  THE COARSE-RESOLUTION (>1 KM) OCEAN COLOR PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN MASKED OUT AT THE PROXIMITY OF SEA-ICE  CLOUDS  AND LAND FEATURES (UN-WANTED PHOTONS REACHING THE FIELD OF VIEW OF THE REMOTE SENSOR). THIS RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF DATA AT CRITICAL NEAR-SHORE AND MARGINAL ICE ZONES. WITH THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF THE OPERATIONAL LAND IMAGER (OLI) ONBOARD LANDSAT-8 AND THE VERY RECENT LAUNCH OF THE MULTISPECTRAL INSTRUMENT (MSI) ABOARD SENTINEL-2 BY ESA  THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY WILL BE IN A POSITION WHERE THE ARCTIC SEAS (AND OTHER HIGH-LATITUDE REGIONS) WILL BE OBSERVED AT MODERATE SPATIAL SCALES (10 TO 60 M) AND TEMPORAL FREQUENCIES (NEAR-DAILY) THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN POSSIBLE. AT SUCH SPATIAL SCALES  THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENTS OF THE RIVERINE AND ESTUARINE SYSTEMS IN THE COASTAL ARCTIC ZONE DURING DIFFERENT PHASES INCLUDING END OF SPRING (PEAK DISCHARGES)  MID SUMMER (HIGH-BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES)  AND THE MID-FALL PERIOD (PRE-WINTER PERIOD).

FURTHER TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS INCLUDE ANALYZING ADJACENCY EFFECTS DUE TO ICE  EXTREMELY LOW SIGNAL LEVELS DURING EARLY SPRING- LATE SUMMER  AND SEPARATING PHYTOPLANKTON ABSORPTION AND ABSORPTION DUE TO DETRITUS AND COLORED DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER. WE WILL FURTHER UTILIZE OLI PANCHROMATIC BAND AND MSI VISIBLE CHANNELS TO MAP AND MONITOR DYNAMICS OF MELT PONDS AND ICE LEADS DURING EARLY SPRING TIMEFRAME.

"METEORIFICS  LLC.","","United States","","","","","I HAVE RECENTLY FINISHED DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF A NEW  ADVANCED SHADOW MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE FOR OBTAINING THE DIMENSIONS OF SIMPLE IMPACT CRATERS FROM SHADOWS  AND HAVE IMPLEMENTED IT AS A COMPUTER PROGRAM (CRATERZ) WHICH IS PRACTICAL TO USE ON LARGE POPULATIONS OF CRATERS  AND IT IS READY FOR USE. IT HAS CONSIDERABLE ADVANTAGES OVER EXISTING METHODS (E.G. STEREOGRAMMETRY  PHOTOCLINOMETRY  ALTIMETRY  OTHER SHADOW METHODS) AND YIELDS NOT ONLY CRATER DIMENSIONS  BUT CROSS SECTIONAL SHAPE  IN THE FORM OF A SET OF THREE SIMPLE PARAMETERS. IN THIS PROJECT I WILL USE CRATERZ TO ADDRESS SEVERAL BASIC QUESTIONS RELATED TO IMPACT CRATERING IN THE FORM OF SEVERAL OBJECTIVES  EACH ADDRESSING SPECIFIC ISSUES.  OBJECTIVES: 1: COMPILE AND PUBLISH A DATABASE OF 1000-2000  0.4-6.0 KM DIAMETER LUNAR SIMPLE IMPACT CRATER SHAPES AND DEPTHS FROM MARE SERENITATIS AND (IF NEEDED TO INCLUDE SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF LARGER CRATERS) MARE IMBRIUM. TAKE A SMALLER SAMPLING (100-200 CRATERS) FROM ADJACENT LUNAR HIGHLANDS FOR COMPARISON. 2: ESTABLISH A NEW PARADIGM FOR THE SHAPES OF SMALL  SIMPLE IMPACT CRATERS ON THE MOON AND BEYOND. MY PILOT STUDIES FOR THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH CLEARLY INDICATE THAT THE CURRENT PARADIGM FOR SIMPLE CRATER SHAPE IS INACCURATE - MOST SIMPLE CRATERS ARE NOT CLOSE TO PARABOLIC. USING THE CRATER SHAPE DATASET I WILL DERIVE A BETTER MODEL FOR THEIR SHAPES. 3: DETERMINE HOW THE SHAPES OF SIMPLE CRATERS ARE RELATED TO THE EVOLUTION OF CRATER-AGE RELATED FEATURES SUCH AS BRIGHT EJECTA  SHARP RIMS  AND SUBSEQUENT CRATERING. FEATURES SUCH AS THESE CHANGE WITH TIME AND ARE CURRENTLY USED AS QUALITATIVE CRATER-AGE INDICATORS. RELATING THE CRATER SHAPE PARAMETERS TO THE EVOLUTION OF THESE FEATURES WILL RESULT IN A MORE QUANTITATIVE CRATER AGE/DEGRADATION SCALE.  MEASURING A SUB-POPULATION OF 200-300 BRIGHT HALO CRATERS WILL PROVIDE A ZERO POINT FOR THS SCALE. 4: COMPARE THE SHAPES OF LUNAR MARIA CRATERS WITH THOSE MEASURED WITHIN HIGHLANDS UNITS. PREVIOUS RESEARCH INDICATES THAT MARIA SIMPLE CRATERS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY DEEPER THAN COMPARABLE HIGHLANDS CRATERS. MY PILOT STUDY RESULTS TEND TO AGREE WITH THIS RESULT  BUT IT ALSO INDICATES THAT MARIA SIMPLE CRATERS ARE CONSIDERABLY  AND SYSTEMATICALLY  MORE  BOWL-SHAPED  THAN HIGHLANDS CRATERS  WHICH TEND TO BE MORE CONICAL IN SHAPE. 5: ANALYZE A SET OF DEFINITIVELY IDENTIFIABLE  SIMPLE  SECONDARY CRATERS  MEASURE THEIR SHAPE CHARACTERISTICS  AND DETERMINE HOW THEY DIFFER FROM THOSE OF THE MORE GENERAL CRATER POPULATION  AND FROM THOSE OF KNOWN PRIMARY CRATERS. THE IDENTIFIABLE SHAPE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SECONDARY AND PRIMARY CRATERS WILL PROVIDE A MEANS OF DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THEM  AND POSSIBLY ENDING A LONG-RUNNING DEBATE. RELEVANCE: A MAJOR PRODUCT OF THIS WORK WILL BE A DATABASE OF SEVERAL THOUSAND LUNAR CRATER SHAPES COMPILED USING THE NEW LRO DATABASE AND IMAGERY. I WILL ALSO ANALYZE HOW THEIR SHAPES VARY WITH AGE  SIZE  AND LOCATION ON THE MOON  AND DERIVE A NEW  SIMPLE CRATER SHAPE MODEL TO REPLACE THE CURRENTLY PREVALENT PARABOLIC ONE. IT IS THEREFORE RELEVANT TO THE LUNAR DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAM. BUT IT WILL ALSO HAVE IMPLICATIONS FAR BEYOND THE MOON; ITS RESULTS WILL BE APPLICABLE TO MANY CRATERED SURFACES ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM BEYOND THE MOON. AT A FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL  THIS WORK WILL USE THE MOON AS A LABORATORY TO CHARACTERIZE THE SHAPES OF ONE OF THE MOST UBIQUITOUS SURFACE FEATURES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM: SIMPLE IMPACT CRATERS.","","2018","$70,334","$0","$70,334","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Alaska", "","","","",""

CORAL REEFS ARE ALSO HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS CAUSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT  INCLUDING OCEAN ACIDIFICATION  NEAR-SHORE POLLUTION AND SEDIMENTATION  AND INCREASING OCEAN TEMPERATURES. BECAUSE CORAL REEF ECOSYSTEMS SUPPORT SUCH DIVERSE OCEAN LIFE  THEY ALSO REPRESENT IMPORTANT HUMAN RESOURCES (FISHERIES) THAT CONTINUE TO BE THREATENED BY IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

WE WILL ALSO INVESTIGATE HOW LAND-USE/LAND-COVER CHANGE IN THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS IS RELATED TO THESE ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES  AND DEVELOP PREDICTIVE MODELS BASED ON THE HYSPIRI-LIKE DATA TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT CAUSES SHIFTS IN BENTHIC COMMUNITY STRUCTURE. THE STUDY WILL FOCUS ON CORAL REEFS IN KANEOHE BAY  OAHU AND KEALAKEKUA BAY  HAWAII AND COMPARE BOTH REEF SYSTEMS TO EXAMINE HOW HUMAN DEVELOPMENT CAN AFFECT CORAL HEALTH.

"SCIENCE SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS  INC.","SAIC","United States","","","","","THE CONTRIBUTION OF ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOLS TO THE EARTH S ENERGY BUDGET IS AN IMPORTANT  YET RELATIVELY UNCERTAIN  COMPONENT OF THE EARTH SYSTEM. STRATOSPHERIC AEROSOLS REPRESENT A LESS WELL-STUDIED  BUT NEVERTHELESS SIGNIFICANT  ELEMENT OF THIS CONTRIBUTION THROUGH THEIR IMPACT ON DIRECT RADIATIVE FORCING OF THE CLIMATE SYSTEM. COMPREHENSIVE MEASUREMENTS OF AEROSOL EXTINCTION VERTICAL PROFILES WITH DENSE SPATIAL SAMPLING ARE NEEDED TO BETTER CONSTRAIN CLIMATE MODEL SIMULATIONS OF AEROSOL EXTINCTION  COMPOSITION  AND PARTICLE SIZE  IN ORDER TO COMPUTE CLIMATE IMPACTS. THE MOST EFFECTIVE SOURCE OF STRATOSPHERIC AEROSOL EXTINCTION DATA COMES FROM SATELLITE LIMB SCATTERING MEASUREMENTS  WHICH PROVIDE GREATER SENSITIVITY THAN SPACE-BASED LIDAR AND MUCH BETTER SPATIAL SAMPLING THAN OCCULTATION MEASUREMENTS. THE OZONE MAPPING AND PROFILING SUITE (OMPS) LIMB PROFILER (LP)  CURRENTLY FLYING ON THE SUOMI NATIONAL POLARORBITING PARTNERSHIP (S-NPP) SATELLITE  HAS BEEN PROVIDING DAILY AEROSOL EXTINCTION PROFILE DATA FROM LIMB SCATTERING MEASUREMENTS SINCE APRIL 2012. WHILE THE S-NPP OMPS LP INSTRUMENT WAS DESIGNED FOR A 7-YEAR OPERATING LIFETIME  THE NEXT OMPS LP INSTRUMENT IS NOT SCHEDULED TO FLY UNTIL 2022. THIS RAISES THE POSSIBILITY OF A DATA GAP IN THIS CRUCIAL MEASUREMENT. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT  CALLED GLOBAL AEROSOL MONITORING SYSTEM (GAMS)  TO SUPPLEMENT THE OMPS LP MEASUREMENTS. OUR DESIGN USES MULTIPLE VIEWING DIRECTIONS TO IMPROVE SPATIAL SAMPLING AND PROVIDE MORE BALANCED MEASUREMENT SENSITIVITY THROUGHOUT THE ORBIT COMPARED TO OMPS LP. WAVELENGTH SELECTION IN THIS DESIGN IS LIMITED TO SIMPLE FILTERS (675 NM FOR AEROSOL SCIENCE  350 NM FOR ALTITUDE REGISTRATION) TO ENABLE A COMPACT INSTRUMENT SUITABLE FOR CUBESAT DEPLOYMENT. THIS PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED WITH NASA GSFC INTERNAL FUNDING  AND CURRENTLY MEETS TRL 2 CRITERIA. THIS PROPOSAL TO THE INSTRUMENT/MEASUREMENT CONCEPT DEMONSTRATION SUBELEMENT OF THE INSTRUMENT INCUBATOR PROGRAM (IIP-ICD) DESCRIBES OUR PLANS TO IMPROVE THE GAMS DESIGN TO PRODUCE A MORE SCIENTIFICALLY CAPABLE AND FLIGHT-READY INSTRUMENT (MULTI-ANGLE STRATOSPHERIC RADIOMETER  MASTAR). THE MASTAR CONCEPT WAS FORMALLY SUBMITTED TO THE 2017 DECADAL SURVEY FOR EARTH SCIENCE SECOND REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IN MAY 2016. ADDING A SECOND CHANNEL AT 1020 NM FOR SCIENCE MEASUREMENTS WILL IMPROVE AEROSOL DETECTION CAPABILITIES AT LOW ALTITUDES  HELP DETERMINE AEROSOL PARTICLE SIZE PROPERTIES  AND INCREASE CONTINUITY WITH HERITAGE DATA SETS. OPTICAL DESIGN STUDIES WILL BE PERFORMED TO OPTIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE OF MASTAR AND QUANTIFY STRAY LIGHT BEHAVIOR. WE WILL ALSO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF INCORPORATING ONBOARD DATA PROCESSING CAPABILITIES TO SATISFY THE SCIENCE OBJECTIVES. THE GOAL OF THIS EFFORT IS TO HAVE A LABORATORY TESTED MASTAR INSTRUMENT AT TRL 4 BY THE END OF THE IIP AWARD PERIOD. WE DO NOT INCLUDE A DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN IN THIS PROPOSAL  FOLLOWING GUIDANCE PROVIDED AT THE NSPIRES WEB SITE.","","2018","$74,238","$0","$74,238","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Maryland", "Virginia","USA","publicly traded","information technology","information technology"

"G & A TECHNICAL SOFTWARE INC","","United States","","","","","RECENT STUDIES INDICATE THAT THE OCCURRENCE AND BRIGHTNESSOF POLAR MESOSPHERIC CLOUDS DIMINISH FOLLOWING ENHANCED PLANETARY ROSSBY WAVE ACTIVITY AND WARM WINTER STRATOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES. THEORETICAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE CAUSE OF THIS APPARENT TELECONNECTION HAVE TARGETED THE RESPONSE OF THE GRAVITY WAVE (GW)-DRIVEN MESOSPHERIC CIRCULATION TO ENHANCED PRW FORCING IN THE WINTER STRATOSPHERE. HOWEVER  IT IS KNOWN THAT THE MESOSPHERIC 2-DAY WAVE WAS ALSO ENHANCED DURING SEASONS OF INCREASED PRW ACTIVITY AND REDUCED PMC BRIGHTNESS. MOMENTUM DEPOSITION BY DISSIPATING 2-DAY WAVES DRIVES A CIRCULATION THAT CAN WARM THE POLAR SUMMER MESOPAUSE BY AS MUCH AS 5K. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ARCTIC WINTER PRW ACTIVITY AND SUMMER MESOSPHERIC 2-DAY WAVE ENHANCEMENTS HAS NOT BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATED IN OBSERVATIONS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE HEMISPHERIC LINKAGE IS EFFECTED BY MERIDIONAL CIRCULATIONS THAT ATTEND INERTIAL INSTABILITY OUTBREAKS IN THE EQUATORIAL MESOSPHERE  THAT SEED THE 2-DAY WAVE IN THE SUMMER MESOSPHERE. THE LEADING OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE TO HARNESS SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS TO EXPLICITLY QUANTIFY THE EFFECTS OF THE 2-DAY WAVE UPON PMC  AND THE COUPLING OF THE 2-DAY WAVE TO PRW BREAKING AND INERTIAL INSTABILITY. WE WILL 1. COMPUTE 2-DAY WAVE FORCING FROM TEMPERATURES MAPPED DURING THE AIM MISSION AUSTRAL SUMMERS  AND EXAMINE THE RESPONSE OF THE SUMMER MESOPAUSE TO THIS FORCING USING A 2D MODEL; 2. EVALUATE THE SENSITIVITY OF ICE FORMATION AND OCCURRENCE IN A 0-D MODEL TO 2-DAY WAVE FORCING  AND COMPARE WITH AIM DATA; 3. ANALYZE CONCURRENT WINTERTIME PLANETARY WAVES ANDINERTIAL INSTABILITY IN TIMED AND AURA TEMPERATURES AND ESTIMATE THEIR WAVE FORCING  AND 4. USE A PRIMITIVEEQUATION MODEL TO EXPLICITLY EVALUATE THE RESPONSE OFTHE SUMMER EASTERLY JET TO FORCING BY PLANETARY WAVESAND INERTIAL INSTABILITY. THE PROPOSED WORK DESCRIBES AN END-TO-END STUDY QUANTIFYING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF PLANETARY WAVE-DRIVEN CIRCULATIONS TO THE ARCTIC-SUMMER MESOPAUSE TELECONNECTION.

"NORTHWEST RESEARCH ASSOCIATES  INC.","","United States","","","","","WE PROPOSE SATELLITE OBSERVATIONAL ANALYSIS AND MODELING STUDIES TO INFORM THE ROLES OF GRAVITY WAVE DYNAMICS ON CHEMICAL TRANSPORT  WHICH HAVE IMPACTS ON STRATOSPHERIC CHEMICAL LIFETIMES  STRATOSPHERE-TROPOSPHERE EXCHANGE  VARIABILITY IN RADIATIVELY ACTIVE GASES  AND ASSOCIATED EFFECTS ON CLIMATE. WHILE THE TRADITIONAL VIEW OF STRATOSPHERIC TRANSPORT PRIMARILY HIGHLIGHTS THE ROLE OF GRAVITY WAVES IN DRIVING THE MESOSPHERIC CIRCULATION  RECENT RESEARCH HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF GRAVITY WAVE DRAG DIRECTLY IN THE STRATOSPHERE  AND ADDITIONAL RESEARCH SUGGESTS IMPORTANT ROLES IN FINE-SCALE STRATOSPHERE-TROPOSPHERE EXCHANGE PROCESSES. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL UTILIZE A VARIETY OF NASA SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS  INCLUDING RECORDS LONGER THAN A DECADE  TO ADDRESS PROCESSES WITHIN LOCAL EVENTS AS WELL AS LONG-TERM GLOBAL VARIABILITY. OUR WORK VERY DIRECTLY ADDRESSES ONE OF THE  OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS FOR THE COMING DECADE  REPORTED FOLLOWING THE 2014 WORKSHOP ON ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION  CHEMISTRY  DYNAMICS AND RADIATION AT NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTER  NAMELY   WHAT ROLE DO GRAVITY WAVES PLAY IN DRIVING THE LARGE-SCALE CIRCULATION?  SPECIFIC TO THE AURA SCIENCE TEAM/ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION MODELING AND ANALYSIS PROGRAM (AST/ACMAP) ANNOUNCEMENT  THE WORK FOCUSES ON MEASUREMENTS FROM THE HIGH RESOLUTION DYNAMICS LIMB SOUNDER (HIRDLS) AND MICROWAVE LIMB SOUNDER (MLS) INSTRUMENTS ON AURA TOGETHER WITH OTHER SATELLITE-BASED PRODUCTS AND PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED IDEALIZED MODEL TOOLS TO CONSTRAIN REGIONAL GRAVITY WAVE DRAG EVENTS  STUDY THEIR DYNAMICAL INTERACTIONS WITH ROSSBY WAVES  AND ASSESS EFFECTS IN CHEMICAL TRACER MEASUREMENTS. GRAVITY WAVE DRAG IS ONE COMPONENT OF THE WAVE-DRIVEN FORCE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GLOBAL STRATOSPHERIC TRANSPORT CIRCULATION  THE BREWER-DOBSON CIRCULATION  NAMED FOR THE PIONEERING WORK OF A.W. BREWER AND G.M.B. DOBSON WHO INFERRED THIS GLOBAL EQUATOR-TOPOLE CIRCULATION FROM MEASUREMENTS OF OZONE AND WATER VAPOR. THE BREWER-DOBSON CIRCULATION HAS A RANGE OF IMPACTS ON ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND CLIMATE. TO FIRST ORDER IT EXPLAINS THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE AGE OF STRATOSPHERIC AIR  WHICH HAS IMPORTANT EFFECTS ON THE LIFETIMES OF OZONE-DEPLETING SUBSTANCES AND SOME GREENHOUSE GASES. IT HAS A DOMINANT INFLUENCE ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE VERY COLD TROPICAL TROPOPAUSE AND CORRESPONDING INFLUENCES ON TROPICAL CIRRUS CLOUDS AND GLOBAL WATER VAPOR WITH ASSOCIATED RADIATIVE EFFECTS AND ROLE IN SURFACE TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY. IN GENERAL  THE BREWER-DOBSON CIRCULATION DESCRIBES THE RECIRCULATION PATHWAYS AND THE PROCESSING TIME OF CHEMICAL TRACERS THROUGH THE STRATOSPHERE AND THEIR EVENTUAL RETURN TO THE TROPOSPHERE  THEREBY ALSO COMPRISING A MAJOR COMPONENT OF STRATOSPHERE-TROPOSPHERE EXCHANGE. THE CURRENT PARADIGM REPRESENTED IN THE WAY SMALL-SCALE GRAVITY WAVE DRAG PROCESSES ARE TREATED IN GLOBAL MODELS SUGGESTS THAT ONLY OROGRAPHIC GRAVITY WAVE DRAG AFFECTS THE STRATOSPHERE  WHILE WAVES FROM OTHER SOURCES  LIKE CONVECTION  PRIMARILY ONLY AFFECT THE MESOSPHERE DIRECTLY. RECENT OBSERVATIONAL EVIDENCE TELLS A VERY DIFFERENT STORY: INFREQUENT  BUT VERY LARGE AMPLITUDE NON-OROGRAPHIC GRAVITY WAVES  CARRY A LARGE FRACTION OF THE CIRCULATION-DRIVING FLUX UPWARD ACROSS THE TROPOPAUSE. HENCE  THESE LARGE EVENTS VERY LIKELY FORCE THE LOWER STRATOSPHERE DIRECTLY WITH LOCALIZED INTERMITTENT DRAG FORCES. SUCH REALISTIC GRAVITY WAVE-DRIVEN FORCES IN THE STRATOSPHERE ARE NOT CURRENTLY REPRESENTED IN GLOBAL MODELS. OUR WORK WILL QUANTIFY THESE EVENTS USING AURA AND OTHER SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS  EXAMINE THEIR INTERACTION WITH LARGER-SCALE SYNOPTIC AND PLANETARY WAVES AND INVESTIGATE THEIR EFFECTS ON CHEMICAL TRACERS IN THE STRATOSPHERE. RECENT RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT REALISTICALLY INTERMITTENT GRAVITY WAVE DRAG WILL GIVE RISE TO SIGNIFICANTLY MORE VARIABILITY IN CHEMISTRY-CLIMATE MODELS THAN IS CURRENTLY REPRESENTED WITHIN THE CURRENT PARADIGM.","","2018","$88,886","$0","$88,886","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Washington", "","","","",""

"BC SCIENTIFIC CONSULTING LLC","","United States","","","","","THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO EXTEND LONG TERM MICROWAVE MIDDLE ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENTS OF OZONE  CHLORINE MONOXIDE  AND WATER VAPOR WHICH HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED BY NASA AND HAVE BEEN PART OF THE NETWORK FOR ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION CHANGE NDACC SINCE THE EARLY 1990S. THE MEASUREMENT DATABASE CONSISTS OF O3 AND H2O MEASUREMENTS FROM MAUNA LOA  HAWAII  AND LAUDER  NEW ZEALAND CLO MEASUREMENTS FROM MAUNA KEA  HAWAII AND SCOTT BASE  ANTARCTICA AND H2O MEASUREMENTS FROM TABLE MOUNTAIN  CALIFORNIA. ALL THREE OF THESE SPECIES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE CLIMATE SYSTEM. OZONE MEASUREMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL TO MONITOR THE BEGINNING OF ITS RECOVERY  AND CLO MEASUREMENTS ARE NEEDED TO INTERPRET THIS PROCESS. WATER VAPOR IS THE RESERVOIR OF ODD HYDROGEN IN THE MIDDLEATMOSPHERE  AND IS THEREFORE ALSO IMPORTANT TO OZONE CHEMISTRY. IT HAS ALSO BEEN SUGGESTED THAT VARIATIONS IN STRATOSPHERIC H2O HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON DECADAL SCALE GLOBAL SURFACE CLIMATE CHANGE. TO ILLUSTRATE THE SCIENTIFIC VALUE OF THESE MEASUREMENTS WE DISCUSS SEVERAL STUDIES CONDUCTED DURING THE 2013 2017 PROPOSAL CYCLE WHICHMAKE USE OF THESE LONG TERM DATASETS. THESE INCLUDED LONG TERM TREND STUDIES OF CLO OVER MAUNA KEA CONNOR 2013  STUDIES OF H2O OVER BOTH MAUNA LOA AND TABLE MOUNTAIN NEDOLUHA 2013A NEDOLUHA  2013B  A STUDY OF DIURNAL O3 VARIATIONS OVER MAUNA LOA PARRISH  2014  AND STUDIES OF THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING ATMOSPHERIC DYNAMICS ON O3 NEDOLUHA 2015A NEDOLUHA  2015B. IN ADDITION  A MANUSCRIPT RELATED TO LONG TERM TRENDS IN CLO OVER SCOTT BASE HAS BEEN SUBMITTED NEDOLUHA  2016. FINALLY  THE DATA HAS AND IS BEING USED IN A NUMBER OF STUDIES LED BY OTHER AUTHORS. THE MOST IMPORTANT GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO MAINTAIN STABLE MEASUREMENTS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE ACCURATE DETECTION OF LONG TERM CHANGE. IN ORDER TO ENSURE CONTINUED STABLE OPERATION INSTRUMENTS NEED TO BE UPDATED. THIS WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN THE INSTRUMENTS WITH CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY AND WILL REDUCE THE LONG TERM MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS SO THAT WE CAN KEEP THEM OPERATING WITH A SINGLE FIELD ENGINEER AND SOME ON SITE SUPPORT. THE H2O INSTRUMENTS UNDERWENT SIGNIFICANT UPDATES DURING THE 2009 2013 PROPOSAL CYCLE  AND HAVE REQUIRED MINIMAL TECHNICAL ATTENTION DURING THE 2013 2017 PROPOSAL CYCLE. DURING THE 2013 2017 PROPOSAL CYCLE WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN MAJOR UPGRADES OF THE O3 INSTRUMENT AT MAUNA LOA AND A CLO INSTRUMENT WHICH  BECAUSE OF ANTI TELESCOPE PROTESTS HAD TO BE MOVED FROM MAUNA KEA TO MAUNA LOA. WHILE THE O3 INSTRUMENT HAS NOT YET UNDERGONE A FULL VALIDATION STUDY  SEVERAL MONTHS OF RETRIEVALS AND COMPARISONS WITH AURA MLS SUGGEST THAT IT IS OPERATING SATISFACTORILY. THERE ARE SEVERAL MAJOR TECHNICAL TASKS WHICH WE PLAN TO ACCOMPLISH IN THE 2017 2021 TIMEFRAME. WE PLAN TO REPLACE THE CRYOGENICALLY OPERATING O3 RECEIVERS AT MAUNA LOA AND LAUDER WITH ROOM TEMPERATURE VERSIONS  JUST AS HAS BEEN DONE FOR THE H2O SYSTEMS. WHILE THIS MAY RESULT IN SOME LOSS OF SIGNAL TO NOISE  AND WILL RESULT IN AN INTERRUPTION OF MEASUREMENTS AT LAUDER  ARE NOT  IN GENERAL  SIGNAL TO NOISE LIMITED  AND IT WILL PUT THEM ON A MORE SUSTAINABLE LONG TERM FOOTING. WE HAVE RETRIEVED CLO WITH THE NEW INSTRUMENT NOW ON MAUNA LOA  AND THE INSTRUMENT APPEARS TO BE OPERATING VERY WELL  BUT IT IS NOT YET CLEAR WHETHER CONDITIONS AT THIS SITE  WHICH ARE SOMEWHAT POORER THAN ON MAUNA KEA  WILL ALLOW US TO MAKE SUFFICIENT TREND QUALITYCLO MEASUREMENTS. WE ARE CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING OPTIONS TO RETURN TO MAUNA KEA IN THE EVENT THAT CONDITIONS AT MAUNA LOA ARE FOUND TO BE NOT FULLY SATISFACTORY. THE CHALLENGE OF REPLACING THE AGING SCOTT BASE CLO INSTRUMENT IS THE MOST DAUNTING. AS A FIRST STEP TO THIS WE HAVE NEARLY FINISHED DEVELOPING A NEW CHLOE INSTRUMENT IN THE LAB AT NRL. THIS INSTRUMENT WILL FIRST BE DEPLOYED TO HAWAII  AND  AFTER COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE TWO CLO INSTRUMENTS IN HAWAII WE WILL MOVE ONE TO SCOTT BASE.","","2018","$98,487","$0","$98,487","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","New York", "","","","",""

TWO DATASETS WILL BE USED: (1) DIGITAL DATA FROM THE M3 PDS ARCHIVE  INCLUDING HYPERSPECTRAL DATA FROM TWO MAJOR OPTICAL IMAGING PERIODS  ANCILLARY DATA INCLUDING SPICE KERNELS  SELENOLOCATION FILES  AND ENGINEERING DATA SUFFICIENT TO REPRODUCE AND IMPROVE UPON EARLIER RAY-TRACING RESULTS (BOARDMAN ET AL.  2011; GREEN ET AL.  2011); AND (2) THE FULL-RESOLUTION (~100 M/PIXEL) DIGITAL TERRAIN MODEL (DTM) DERIVED FROM STEREO IMAGING OF THE WIDE ANGLE CAMERA (WAC) INSTRUMENT ON THE LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (E.G.  SCHOLTEN ET AL.  2011). THE WORK CONSISTS OF FIVE MAJOR TASKS: (1) SYSTEMATIC REPROCESSING OF THE FULL DATASET THROUGH THE MISSION-DEVELOPED LEVEL 1B PROCESSING PIPELINE USING THE WAC DTM TO GREATLY IMPROVE SELENOLOCATION ACCURACY; (2) DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE TOOLS FOR PROCESSING M3 DATA MOST IMPORTANTLY  A PHYSICALLY RIGOROUS CAMERA MODEL IN THE USGS ISIS3; (3) USE OF THE ADVANCED CAPABILITIES OF ISIS TO CONTROL THE GLOBAL M3 DATASET WITH IMPROVED ACCURACY AND GENERATE FURTHER IMPROVED LEVEL 1B PRODUCTS; (4) SYSTEMATIC REPROCESSING OF BEST VERSION OF LEVEL 1B DATA THROUGH THE MISSION DEVELOPED LEVEL 2 PROCESSING PIPELINE USING THE WAC DTM TO GREATLY IMPROVE PHOTOMETRIC ACCURACY; (5) GENERATION OF A COMPLETE SET OF ORTHORECTIFIED AND MOSAICKED (LEVEL 3) DATA PRODUCTS INCLUDING PHOTOMETRICALLY NORMALIZED SPECTRA AND SPECTRAL PARAMETER MAPS; AND (6) DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS  WITH INTERIM RESULTS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE ONLINE AND FINAL SPICE KERNELS  LEVEL 1B AND LEVEL 3 PRODUCTS FORMALLY ARCHIVED TO THE IMAGING NODE OF THE PLANETARY DATA SYSTEM (PDS). THE MULTIPLE PRODUCTS GENERATED BY THIS EFFORT WILL SERVE THE BROADEST POSSIBLE SET OF SCIENTIFIC APPLICATIONS OF THE M3 DATASET. LEVEL 1B PRODUCTS  WHICH ARE NOT SPATIALLY RESAMPLED  ARE ESSENTIAL FOR STUDIES REQUIRING THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE SPECTRAL FIDELITY  AND THE IMPROVED SELENOLOCATION ACCURACY OF OUR RESULTS WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PHOTOMETRIC NORMALIZATION OF THESE DATA AND FACILITATE COMPARISON WITH OTHER DATASETS. THE RESAMPLED LEVEL 3 PRODUCTS WILL GREATLY SIMPLIFY THE USE OF M3 FOR REGIONAL STUDIES IN WHICH SUMMARY SPECTRAL CHARACTERISTICS SUFFICE. FINALLY  THE COMBINATION OF A FULL SET OF ISIS TOOLS PLUS IMPROVED SPICE DATA WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR USERS WHOSE SPECIAL NEEDS ARE NOT MET BY EITHER OF THESE PRODUCT SETS TO DO THEIR OWN M3 PROCESSING.","","2018","$99,019","$0","$99,019","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Virginia", "","","","",""

"PREDICTIVE SCIENCE INCORPORATED","","United States","","","","","THE ORIGIN OF THE SLOW SOLAR WIND IS CONTROVERSIAL; HOWEVER  THE BOUNDARIES OF CORONAL HOLES CLEARLY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE. ONE GROUP OF THEORIES ARGUES THAT THE SLOW WIND PRIMARILY ARISES QUASI-STATICALLY FROM THE LARGE MAGNETIC EXPANSION FACTOR IN THESE REGIONS  WHILE ANOTHER SET OF THEORIES CONTENDS THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE SLOW SOLAR WIND ARISES DYNAMICALLY VIA THE RECONNECTION OF OPEN AND CLOSED FIELDS IN THE CORONA. RECONNECTION BETWEEN OPEN AND CLOSED FIELDS IS CLOSELY RELATED TO CORONAL HOLE EVOLUTION - THESE EVENTS ALTER THE BOUNDARIES AND CHANGE THE AREA OF CORONAL HOLES. WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE EVOLUTION OF CORONAL HOLES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE ORIGIN OF THE SLOW SOLAR WIND. OUR WORK COMBINES THE ADAPT FLUX TRANSPORT MODEL  THE MAS MHD SIMULATION CODE  EUV IMAGING (STEREO EUVI AND SDO AIA)  AND IN SITU COMPOSITION AND CHARGE STATE MEASUREMENTS FROM ACE. SPECIFICALLY  WE PLAN TO DRIVE TIME-DEPENDENT MHD SOLUTIONS OF THE MAS CODE FOR EXTENDED TIME PERIODS (2-3 CARRINGTON ROTATIONS) USING FULL SUN MAPS GENERATED BY ADAPT (INGESTING SDO/HMI MAGNETOGRAMS). THE MODELED CORONAL HOLE EVOLUTION WILL BE QUANTITATIVELY COMPARED WITH CORONAL HOLE CHANGES OBSERVED BY STEREO EUVI AND SDO AIA. WE WILL IDENTIFY THE TOPOLOGICAL CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVOLUTION AND DETERMINE WHAT PORTION OF THE HELIOSPHERIC MAGNETIC FLUX IS DUE TO INTERCHANGE RECONNECTION. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO ASSESS WHAT THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF RECONNECTED FLUX IS TO THE SLOW SOLAR WIND. ONE OF THE COMPELLING ARGUMENTS FOR A DYNAMIC ORIGIN OF THE SLOW WIND IS THE DIFFERENCES IN CHARGE STATES AND COMPOSITION BETWEEN FAST AND SLOW WIND. IF THIS ARGUMENT IS CORRECT  THERE SHOULD BE A CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN CORONAL HOLE EVOLUTION  IONIC COMPOSITION  AND CHARGE-STATE DISTRIBUTION IN THE SOLAR WIND. WE WILL TEST THIS PREDICTION USING MEASUREMENTS FROM THE ACE SPACECRAFT. OUR PROPOSED WORK COMBINES THEORY  NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS  AND DATA FROM NASA HELIOPHYSICS MISSIONS TO INVESTIGATE A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION: WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THE SLOW SOLAR WIND? AS SUCH  OUR WORK ADDRESSES THREE OF THE FOUR HIGH-LEVEL SCIENCE GOALS OF THE HELIOPHYSICS DECADAL SURVEY: (1) DETERMINE THE ORIGINS OF THE SUN'S ACTIVITY AND PREDICT THE VARIATIONS IN THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT; (3) DETERMINE THE INTERACTION OF THE SUN WITH THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND THE INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM; AND (4) DISCOVER AND CHARACTERIZE FUNDAMENTAL PROCESSES THAT OCCUR BOTH WITHIN THE HELIOSPHERE AND THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE.","","2018","$101,012","$0","$101,012","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","California", "","","","",""

"PREDICTIVE SCIENCE INCORPORATED","","United States","","","","","WE PROPOSE TO USE TWO POWERFUL DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES  NAMELY  TIME LAG ANALYSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL EMISSION MEASURE (DEM) ANALYSIS TO INVESTIGATE THE PROPERTIES OF THREE DIFFERENT CORONAL HEATING MODELS  TO RELATE THEM TO EUV AND X-RAY OBSERVATIONS OF ACTIVE-REGION CORONAL LOOPS  AND TO DETERMINE WHICH MODEL  IF ANY  IS CONSISTENT WITH THE OBSERVATIONS. THE ANALYSES WILL BE APPLIED TO EUV AND X-RAY OBSERVATIONS FROM THE EUV AIA IMAGER ON SDO  THE XRT X-RAY IMAGER ON HINODE  AND THE EUV EIS SPECTROMETER  ALSO ON HINODE. THE TIME LAGS ARE MEASURABLE DELAYS BETWEEN WHEN CORONAL LOOPS APPEAR IN DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE CHANNELS. WHEN ASSEMBLED INTO MAPS  THEY REVEAL A RICH MORPHOLOGY OF ACTIVE-REGION LOOPS  AND CONTAIN A WEALTH OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE CORONAL HEATING MECHANISM. MEANWHILE  DEM ANALYSIS HAS PROVEN TO BE A POWERFUL TECHNIQUE TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMISSION AND HEATING. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMBINE THESE TWO POWERFUL DIAGNOSTICS TO COMPREHENSIVELY TEST THE PREDICTIONS FROM THEORETICAL MODELS. WE WILL TEST THE FOLLOWING THREE CORONAL HEATING MODELS:  - AN EMPIRICAL HEATING MODEL INSPIRED BY THE SCALING FROM WEAK MHD TURBULENCE SIMULATIONS OF PARKER S TOPOLOGICAL DISSIPATION MECHANISM;  - A NEW WAVE-TURBULENCE-DRIVEN (WTD) MODEL IN WHICH THE HEATING IS PRODUCED BY THE DISSIPATION OF ALFV N WAVES LAUNCHED AT THE BASE OF LOOPS IN THE CHROMOSPHERE;  - A NANOFLARE HEATING MODEL IN WHICH LOOPS ARE HEATED IMPULSIVELY IN A REPETITIVE FASHION. THE EMPIRICAL HEATING MODEL HAS ALREADY BEEN USED EXTENSIVELY  BOTH IN THE 1D AND 3D FRAMEWORKS. NANOFLARE HEATING IS THE MOST POPULAR CORONAL-LOOP HEATING MODEL IN THE FIELD. IN ADDITION TO ITS APPLICATION ON INDIVIDUAL LOOPS (IN 1D)  WE WILL EXTEND ITS IMPLEMENTATION TO 3D. THE WTD MODEL IS CURRENTLY UNDER STUDY IN OUR GROUP AS A CANDIDATE FOR OUR GLOBAL CORONAL AND SOLAR WIND ACCELERATION MODEL. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL UTILIZE AN EXISTING 1D CODE TO STUDY INDIVIDUAL CORONAL LOOPS  AS WELL AS AN EXISTING 3D MHD CODE TO STUDY WHOLE ACTIVE REGIONS. WE WILL COMPUTE DEMS AND TIME LAGS BETWEEN THE VARIOUS PASSBANDS IN THE MODELS  AND WE WILL COMPARE THEM WITH THOSE INFERRED FROM OBSERVATIONS. WE WILL APPLY OUR ANALYSIS ON A WELL-OBSERVED ACTIVE-REGION WITH EXTENSIVE EUV AND X-RAY MEASUREMENTS. THE RESULTS WILL DETERMINE WHICH FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL MECHANISM (NANOFLARES VS. WAVE HEATING) FITS THE OBSERVATIONS BEST. WE EXPECT THIS WORK TO GIVE US DEEP INSIGHT INTO THE PROCESS OF CORONAL HEATING ON ACTIVE-REGION SCALES.","","2018","$109,107","$0","$109,107","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","California", "","","","",""

NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS ADDRESSING THESE MECHANISMS HAVE BEEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY RESTRICTED TO ONE-DIMENSIONAL (1D) THERMODYNAMIC CALCULATIONS ALONG STATIC MAGNETIC FIELD LINES. 3D SIMULATIONS ARE CLEARLY REQUIRED TO SUBSTANTIATE AND EXTEND THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY THESE INVESTIGATIONS. WE THEREFOREPROPOSE TO MODEL THE FORMATION AND INTERNAL DYNAMICS OF PROMINENCES  USING NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS THAT CONSIDER A FULLY 3D TREATMENT OF THE THERMODYNAMICS AND TIME-DEPENDENT MAGNETIC FIELDS. WE WILL FOCUS ON THE THERMAL NON EQUILIBRIUM MECHANISM FOR PROMINENCE FORMATION  BUT WE WILL CONSIDER ALSO MAGNETIC FORCES SUCH AS PLASMA LEVITATION AND INJECTION. OUR SIMULATIONS WILL ALLOW US TO THOROUGHLY TEST THESE MECHANISMS AND TO STUDY THE RESULTING DYNAMICS IN A MORE REALISTIC MAGNETIC FIELD AND PLASMA ENVIRONMENTTHAN DONE SO FAR. THEY WILL ALSO PROVIDE PRE-ERUPTIVE CONFIGURATIONS FOR CME SIMULATIONS THAT CONTAIN SELF-CONSISTENTLY PRODUCED PROMINENCE PLASMA DISTRIBUTIONS.TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES WE WILL EMPLOY OUR THERMODYNAMIC MHD CODE MAS (MAGNETO-HYDRODYNAMICS AROUND A SPHERE)  DEVELOPED AND MAINTAINED AT PREDICTIVE SCIENCE INC.

ARE THESE CONDITIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE FOUND IN 1D SIMULATIONS? (2) ARE FIELD-LINE DIPS REQUIRED IN 3D MAGNETIC FIELDS TO FORM LONG-LASTING CONDENSATIONS? (3) CAN THERMAL NON-EQUILIBRIUM EXPLAIN THE FORMATION OF ACTIVE-REGION PROMINENCES  WHICH APPEAR TO BE TOO SHORT FOR CATASTROPHIC COOLING TO OCCUR? (4) CAN FORMATION MECHANISMS BASED ON MAGNETIC FORCES SUCH AS PLASMA LEVITATION AND INJECTION ACCOUNT FOR THE HEIGHT AND MASS OF OBSERVED PROMINENCES? (5) WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE ""PROMINENCE-CORONA TRANSITIONREGION""? IN PARTICULAR  WHAT IS THE MAGNETIC FIELD STRUCTURE AND WHAT ARE THE VALUES OF PLASMA DENSITY  TEMPERATURE  AND VELOCITY IN THISREGION? (6) UNDER WHICH CONDITIONS DO CORONAL CAVITIES FORM?

BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGH SENSITIVITY TO UPPER ATMOSPHERIC WATER VAPOR AND TEMPERATURE  CHANGES IN PMC FREQUENCY AND DISTRIBUTION ARE REGARDED AS POSSIBLE MARKERS OF LONG-TERM GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. SOME LONG-TERM SATELLITE DATA STUDIES SUGGEST THAT IN RECENT DECADES PMCS ARE BECOMING BRIGHTER  OCCURRING MORE FREQUENTLY  AND EXTENDING TO LOWER LATITUDES. HOWEVER  ANALYSIS OF GROUND-BASED CLOUD DATA OVER THE SAME PERIOD INDICATES NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT TREND IN MODERATE OR BRIGHT PMC.PMC BRIGHTNESS IS KNOWN TO BE MODULATED BY TIDES. HOWEVER  EXISTING STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED ONLY THE EFFECTS OF MIGRATING TIDES  THAT ARE SUN-SYNCHRONOUS AND APPEAR AS LONGITUDINALLY INVARIANT FEATURES IN SATELLITE DATA. NONMIGRATING TIDES TRAVEL WITH AN ANGULAR PHASE SPEED THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM EARTH'S ROTATION  AND REGISTER IN THE SATELLITE DATA RECORD AS LONGITUDINALLY VARIABLE FEATURES. NONMIGRATING TEMPERATURE PERTURBATIONS RANGE BETWEEN 3-6 K AT INDIVIDUAL LONGITUDES. HOWEVER  THEIR EFFECTS UPON PMC BRIGHTNESS AND OCCURRENCE HAVE NOT BEEN EXAMINED. KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR INFLUENCE IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT FOR INTERPRETING SPATIALLY VARIABLE PMC OCCURRENCE AND BRIGHTNESS  AND FOR RECONCILING GROUND-BASED OBSERVATIONS FROM A FIXED LOCATION WITH GLOBAL-SCALE SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS.THE OVERARCHING OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE TO DELINEATE LOCAL TIME AND LONGITUDINAL VARIABILITY IN PMC PARAMETERS  AND TO QUANTIFY THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO CONCURRENT GLOBAL TIDAL PERTURBATIONS IN TEMPERATURE.

"CULTURAL SITE RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT  INC.","","United States","","","","","TTHE ENTRY OF HUMANS INTO THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT  COMPELLING  AND DEBATED REALMS OF RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF ARCHAEOLOGY.  OBVIOUSLY RELEVANT TO HUMAN EVOLUTION AND CULTURAL CHANGE  IT CAN ALSO BE ARGUED THAT NO EVENT HAS SO GREATLY INFLUENCED LONG-TERM CLIMATE CHANGE.  CLIMATIC FLUCTUATIONS ALTERNATELY OPENED AND CLOSED THE DOOR FROM THE OLD WORLD TO THE NEW WORLD.  HUMAN OCCUPATION WROUGHT GREAT ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE  WHICH FORMS 28 PERCENT OF THE EARTH'S LANDMASS.  WHILE FULLY MODERN HUMANS INHABITED THE OLD WORLD FOR AT LEAST THE PAST 60 000 YEARS  AND THE DIRECT ANCESTORS OF FULLY MODERN HUMANS FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS BEFORE THAT  DATES FOR HUMANS IN THE NEW WORLD BEFORE 15 000 B.P. ARE GREETED WITH GREAT SKEPTICISM BY ARCHAEOLOGISTS.  RECENT CLIMATE RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT ENTRY ALONG THE WEST COAST OF THE CONTINENT WAS POSSIBLE EARLIER THAN THE ROUTE THROUGH THE LAURENTIDE ICE-FREE CORRIDOR  WHICH HAD BEEN THOUGHT BY MOST ARCHAEOLOGISTS TO HAVE BEEN THE ONLY PLAUSIBLE ROUTE SINCE AT LEAST THE 1930S (GOEBEL  ET AL.  2008).  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH FINDINGS AT THE PAISLEY CAVE IN OREGON THAT OFFER NEAR CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE FOR HUMAN PRESENCE A MILLENNIA BEFORE THE ICE-FREE CORRIDOR OPENED (JENKINS  PERSONAL COMMUNICATION  2011).  HUMANS COMING SOUTH ALONG THE WEST COAST USED AN ASSEMBLAGE OF TOOLS CALLED WESTERN-STEMMED  SAN DIEGUITO  AND SEVERAL OTHER TERMS.  IT IS DIFFERENT FROM TOOLS ASSOCIATED WITH HUMANS THOUGHT TO HAVE FOLLOWED LARGE GAME SOUTH THROUGH THE LAURENTIDE CORRIDOR.  MANY ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT FINELY MADE PROJECTILE POINTS MADE BY THIS LATTER GROUP  CALLED CLOVIS  WERE ESPECIALLY DESIGNED TO HUNT THE MAMMOTH  MASTODON  CAMEL  LONG-HORNED BISON  AND OTHER MAGAFAUNA THAT BECAME EXTINCT WITHIN A FEW THOUSAND YEARS AFTER THE APPEARANCE OF THE CLOVIS CULTURE.  SOME HAVE ARGUED THAT THIS SUGGESTS THAT HUMANS HAD ALTERED THE ECOLOGY OF THE NEW WORLD DRAMATICALLY SOON AFTER ARRIVAL.THE RESEARCH PROPOSED HERE WILL FOCUS ON THE MOJAVE DESERT  A REGION WHERE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT HUMAN GROUPS CONVERGED AS THEY ENTERED THE NEW WORLD VIA THE TWO MOST LIKELY ROUTES.  THE MOJAVE DESERT PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT LABORATORY IN WHICH BOTH GEOLOGY AND THE HUMAN PAST CAN BE STUDIED. DEARTH OF VEGETATION MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO ASCERTAIN LANDFORMS THAT GREATLY INFLUENCED HUMAN USE OF THE REGION.  MANY OF THESE HAVE BEEN ALTERED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE MILLENNIA  YET NASA TECHNOLOGY OFFERS THE MEANS BY WHICH TO COLLECT DATA WITH WHICH TO ACCURATELY MODEL THE ANCIENT PLUVIAL LAKES AND STREAMS THAT FIRST ATTRACTED HUMAN POPULATIONS.  SHORELINES AS THEY WERE DURING PERIODS WHEN HUMANS WERE MOST LIKELY TO HAVE ARRIVED HAVE BEEN OBSCURED OVER MILLENNIA.  WE CAN DISCOVER  MAP  AND MODEL THESE WITH THE USE OF DATA COLLECTED BY NASA AERIAL AND SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING DEVICES.ALSO  THE PRIMARY RESEARCH AREA FOR THIS WORK IS AN IDEAL ENVIRONMENT TO FURTHER TEST CAPABILITY OF IMAGING RADAR OF DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS AND POLARIZATIONS TO 1) PENETRATE ARID SOILS OF DIFFERING GRANULARITY  AND 2) CHARACTERIZE EXPOSED AND NEAR SURFACE LANDFORMS REVEALED BY RADAR AND OTHER REMOTE SENSING DATA.  SAR DATA OVER MUCH OF THE STUDY AREA HAS ALREADY BEEN COLLECTED  BY AIRSAR  UAVSAR  AND ALOS-PALSAR PLATFORMS.  RADAR DATA IN HAND INCLUDES P-  L-  C-BAND MULTIPOLARIZATION SAR. ADDITIONALLY  VISIBLE AND NEAR INFRA-RED IMAGING DATA FROM SATELLITE SYSTEMS SUCH AS LANDSAT  SPOT  ASTER  AND AIRBORNE IMAGING SPECTROSCOPY FROM AVIRIS EXISTS FROM MUCH OF THE AREA.  FURTHERMORE  BECAUSE THE AREA IS VERY NEAR NASA DRYDEN  FROM WHICH THE RECENTLY COMMISSIONED UAVSAR IS FLOWN  IT WILL ALSO BE FEASIBLE TO COLLECT QUAD-POL P-BAND DATA.

"DYNAFLOW  INC","","United States","","","","","EFFECTIVE  LOW POWER  GAS-LIQUID SEPARATION SYSTEMS ARE IMPERATIVE FOR THE OPERATION OF COST-EFFECTIVE TWO-PHASE FLOW SYSTEMS IN SPACE. THE LIMITATIONS ON THE VOLUMES AND WEIGHTS TO BE CARRIED FOR SPACE EXPERIMENTS MAKE IT IMPERATIVE TO HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO SEPARATE GASES FROM LIQUIDS IN ORDER TO RECYCLE AND REUSE BOTH. ONE EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO SO IS TO USE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE. MANY PHASE SEPARATORS DEVICES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AND INVESTIGATED USING THIS FORCE AND PASSIVE SEPARATORS REQUIRING NO MOVING MECHANICAL PARTS AND LOW POWER HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED INTENSIVELY OWING TO THEIR SIMPLICITY AND DEPENDABILITY.

MANY ATMOSPHERIC GRAVITY WAVES ARE GENERATED BY DISTURBANCES IN THE TROPOSPHERE AND STRATOSPHERE. THOSE WAVES  IN TOTAL  CARRY SIGNIFICANT ENERGY AND MOMENTUM VERTICALLY INTO THE THERMOSPHERE-IONOSPHERE  PASSING THROUGH THE MESOSPHEREON THE WAY. THERE HAS BEEN NO ABILITY OR EFFORT  TO DATE  TO GLOBALLY CHARACTERIZE THESE EFFECTS ON THE THERMOSPHERE-IONOSPHERE. AS STATED IN THE HELIOPHYSICS RECOMMENDED ROADMAP FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY  2009-2030  UNDER SOLAR TERRESTRIAL PROBE (STP) 7 ION-NEUTRAL COUPLING IN THE ATMOSPHERE (INCA)  WE KNOW THAT IMPORTANT SOURCES OF ENERGY THAT DRIVE THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE AND IONOSPHERE ARE EXTERNALLY IMPOSED  SUCH AS SOLAR EXTREME ULTRAVIOLET (EUV) RADIATION AND SOLAR ENERGY IMPARTED TO THE ATMOSPHERETHROUGH THE SOLAR WIND AND THE MAGNETOSPHERE DURING MAGNETIC STORMS. HOWEVER  DYNAMICAL DISTURBANCES GENERATED IN THE TROPOSPHERE MODIFY WIND STRUCTURE IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE AND SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE PROPERTIES OF BOTH THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE IONOSPHERE THE GOAL OF THIS INSTRUMENT IS TO TARGET THE GRAVITY-WAVE COMPONENT OF THOSE EFFECTS  ADDRESSING THE QUESTION HOW DO LARGE-SCALE PROCESSES IN THE LOWER AND MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE CONTROL AND INFLUENCE THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE AND IONOSPHERE?THIS PROJECT WILL SIMULTANEOUSLY TACKLE ANOTHER QUESTION DESCRIBED IN THE HELIOPHYSICS ROADMAP.

THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO PERFORM HIGH-SPECTRAL-RESOLUTION TEMPERATURE SENSING OF THE MESOPAUSE REGION VIA O2 A-BAND OBSERVATION. THIS FLEXIBILITY COMES WITH NO ADDITIONAL OUTLAY FOR EQUIPMENT OR INSTRUMENT OPERATION IN FLIGHT.THE MAGWATS WILL PROVIDE WIDE-AREA NIGHTTIME NADIR-VIEWING COVERAGE OF MESOSPHERIC GRAVITY WAVE ACTIVITY  USING A PUSHBROOM IMAGING CONFIGURATION  ON TIME SCALES OF A HALF-SECOND AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION SCALES OF 18 30 KM. ITS TARGET IS A SERIES OF PEAKS INTHE O2 A-BAND (0 0) NEAR 764 NM. THESE BRIGHT LINES HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING HEAVILY SELF-ABSORBING  PREVENTING CONTAMINATION FROM ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES BELOW IN A NADIR-VIEWING CONFIGURATION. THESE LINES ALSO HAVE TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT PEAK RATIOS  SOMESOPAUSE TEMPERATURE NEAR 90 KM CAN BE DETERMINED VERY WELL IF THE PEAKS CAN BE RESOLVED. THE HEART OF MAGWATS IS A ROBUST  MONOLITHIC SPATIAL HETERODYNE SPECTROMETER (SHS)  WHICH HAS THE THROUGHPUT AND HIGH SPECTRAL RESOLUTION FOR BOTH GRAVITY WAVE IMAGING AND TEMPERATURE SENSING.THE MAGWATS IS BEING INITIALLY DESIGNED WITH NANO- AND PICOSATELLITES (E.G.

"METAMAGNETICS INC.","","United States","","","","","THE NASA AEROSOL/CLOUD/ECOSYSTEMS (ACE) MISSION  RECOMMENDED BY THE NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL S EARTH SCIENCE DECADAL SURVEY  WILL SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADVANCED INSTRUMENTS TO MEASURE CLOUD DROPLETS  ICE CRYSTALS  RAIN AND SNOW  AND OTHER HYDROMETEOR TYPES AND TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR DYNAMICS ARE INFLUENCED BY THE PRESENCE OF AEROSOLS. THESE INFLUENCES IMPACT THE EARTH S ECOSYSTEMS AND THE OCEAN S STORAGE OF CARBON DIOXIDE. ACE AND OTHER NASA MISSIONS REQUIRE INNOVATIVE COMPONENT-LEVEL TECHNOLOGY THAT: (I) REDUCES RISK  COST  SIZE  VOLUME  MASS  AND DEVELOPMENT TIME OF EARTH OBSERVING INSTRUMENTS; AND (II) ENABLES NEW DATA ACQUISITION FOR ENHANCED OBSERVATION MEASUREMENTS. IN THE PROPOSED EFFORT METAMAGNETICS INC. IN COLLABORATION WITH A NASA PRIME CONTRACTOR ADDRESSES THESE REQUIREMENTS THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ULTRA-LIGHTWEIGHT  COMPACT  COST-EFFECTIVE  HIGH-PERFORMANCE  MAGNET-LESS CIRCULATOR FOR USE IN SENSORS AND COMMUNICATIONS PHASED ARRAYS. THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS IMPORTANT APPLICATIONS IN ACE AS WELL AS OTHER NASA MISSIONS. A CIRCULATOR PROVIDES DUPLEX CAPABILITY IN A PHASED ARRAY TRANSMIT/RECEIVE MODULE AND ISOLATES AMPLIFIERS FROM UNWANTED REFLECTIONS. CONVENTIONAL FERRITE CIRCULATORS OCCUPY A DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE VOLUME IN THE FRONT-END THE T/R MODULE BECAUSE OF THE LARGE PERMANENT MAGNET REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY MAGNETIC BIAS FIELD. THE MAIN INNOVATION OF THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY CONSISTS IN METAMAGNETICS  PROPRIETARY SELF-BIASED CIRCULATOR SUBSTRATE THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE EXTERNAL BIASING AND ALLOWS>90% REDUCTION IN VOLUME AND WEIGHT OF THE DEVICE. OUR SELF-BIASED CIRCULATOR ELIMINATES THE PERMANENT MAGNET BY UTILIZING A CRYSTALLOGRAPHICALLY TEXTURED MATERIAL THAT POSSESSES HIGH REMNANT MAGNETIZATION AND LOW MICROWAVE LOSSES WHILE IMPROVING RELIABILITY AND SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY. IN A PREVIOUS PHASE I NASA SBIR CONTRACT METAMAGNETICS DEVELOPED A PROOF OF CONCEPT PROTOTYPE OF THE PROPOSED CIRCULATOR DEMONSTRATING TRL 4. OVER THE 36-MONTH PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED EFFORT WE WILL DEVELOP  FABRICATE  AND TEST SELF-BIASED CIRCULATORS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO MEET PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS SET FOR THE NASA AEROSOL/CLOUD/ECOSYSTEMS (ACE) MISSION AND WILL DELIVER MULTIPLE UNITS TO NASA PRIME CONTRACTOR THAT WILL PERFORM SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND SYSTEM TESTING. AT THE END OF THE PROPOSED EFFORT WE PREDICT TO REACH TRL 6. OUR TEAM OF HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS COMBINES METAMAGNETICS  INC. EXPERTISE IN ADVANCED FERRITE-BASED DEVELOPMENT FOR MILITARY SECURITY  SURVEILLANCE AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS  AND NASA PRIME CONTRACTOR SYSTEM ENGINEERING KNOW-HOW IN MICROWAVE RADAR SYSTEMS FOR GROUND-BASED  SPACE  AND AIRBORNE PLATFORMS. NASA PRIME CONTRACTOR IS ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE ACE PROGRAM AND IN VIEW OF METAMAGNETICS  CIRCULATOR TECHNOLOGY HIGH POTENTIAL HAS ALREADY INVESTED $100 000 IN IN-KIND FUNDS TO EVALUATE METAMAGNETICS  SELFBIASED MATERIALS AND CIRCULATOR COMPONENTS.","","2018","$137,946","$0","$137,946","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Massachusetts", "","","","",""

"NORTHWEST RESEARCH ASSOCIATES  INC.","","United States","","","","","WE PROPOSE A FOCUSED STUDY OF HIGH-RESOLUTION GODDARD EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEM (GEOS) MODELING  VALIDATION  AND ANALYSIS TO INVESTIGATE ATMOSPHERIC WAVES AND THEIR INFLUENCES ON WINDS IN THE UPPER TROPOSPHERE AND STRATOSPHERE. WINDS AT THESE LEVELS GUIDE ROSSBY WAVE PROPAGATION AND TELECONNECTION PATTERNS THAT STRONGLY INFLUENCE THE SIMULATION OF REGIONAL-SCALE CLIMATE PATTERNS AND SKILL OF LONG-RANGE WEATHER FORECASTS. MOST CLIMATE AND WEATHER FORECASTING CENTERS HAVE RAISED THEIR MODEL LIDS IN RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE UPPER LEVEL WINDS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SIMULATING THE PROCESSES THAT CONTROL THEM. AT SEASONAL FORECAST MODEL RESOLUTIONS  SMALL-SCALE WAVES REMAIN SEVERELY UNDER-RESOLVED  YET THE INFLUENCE OF THEIR DRAG FORCES ON THE CIRCULATION IN THE UPPER TROPOSPHERE AND STRATOSPHERE MAKE THEM A KEY PLAYER IN PREDICTABILITY. GRAVITY WAVE DRAG PARAMETERIZATIONS THAT TREAT OROGRAPHIC AND NON-OROGRAPHIC WAVES ARE USED TO TUNE BOTH CLIMATE AND FORECAST MODELS WITH DEMONSTRATED EFFECTS ON BIAS REDUCTION AND FORECAST SKILL. THIS PROJECT WILL INFORM IMPROVED METHODS FOR SIMULATING SMALL-SCALE WAVE EFFECTS ON TWO IMPORTANT FEATURES OF THE CIRCULATION WITH DEMONSTRATED INFLUENCE ON SEASONAL PREDICTABILITY: THE TROPICAL LOWER STRATOSPHERE AND THE WINTER SEASON STRATOSPHERIC VORTEX. THIS PUTS OUR FOCUS ON OROGRAPHIC GRAVITY WAVES AND THOSE GENERATED BY LOCALIZED INTENSE RAIN EVENTS. THE NASA GLOBAL MODELING AND ASSIMILATION OFFICE S (GMAO S) GEOS-5 MODEL IS DESIGNED FOR SIMULATION AT A WIDE RANGE OF ATMOSPHERIC RESOLUTIONS: FOR EXAMPLE  IT IS CURRENTLY CONFIGURED FOR CLIMATE SIMULATIONS WITH ~100 KM RESOLUTION  AND SPECIALIZED HINDCASTING EXPERIMENTS ARE ROUTINELY RUN IN THE GRAY ZONE (FOR BOTH DEEP CONVECTION AND GRAVITY WAVES) AT ~6 KM. VERTICAL RESOLUTION IS CURRENTLY 72 LEVELS WITH EFFORTS TO DOUBLE THAT UNDERWAY. ATMOSPHERIC WAVES AND THEIR INTERACTION WITH GLOBAL AND REGIONAL CIRCULATION ARE QUITE SENSITIVE TO THESE RESOLUTION CHOICES  BUT ALSO SENSITIVE TO MOIST PROCESSES  SURFACE DRAG  DIVERGENCE DAMPING  AND OTHER DISSIPATION MECHANISMS. AS A RESULT  RESOLUTION ALONE DICTATES NEITHER THE SCALES OF THE WAVES THAT CAN BE RESOLVED NOR OTHER WAVE PROPERTIES INCLUDING THEIR SOURCES  GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS  AND DRAG ON THE CIRCULATION. FOR EXAMPLE  PREVIOUS HIGHRESOLUTION EXPERIMENTS  LIKE THE 7-KM RESOLUTION NATURE RUN  NEEDED STRONG PARAMETERIZED GRAVITY WAVES TO COUNTERACT THE EFFECTS OF EXPLICIT PLUS IMPLICIT DISSIPATION ON WAVES RESOLVED IN THE MODEL. THE PROJECT APPROACH INCLUDES (I) OBSERVATIONAL VALIDATION OF GRAVITY WAVES AND SMALL-SCALE HEAVY PRECIPITATION EVENTS IN EXISTING AND FUTURE HIGH-RESOLUTION SIMULATIONS WITH DIFFERENT DISSIPATION SETTINGS  (II) EXPLORATORY LIMITED-AREA HIGH-RESOLUTION GEOS EXPERIMENTS TO PROBE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PHYSICS  DISSIPATION  AND RESOLUTION SETTINGS ON SMALL-SCALE RESOLVED GRAVITY WAVES AND LATENT HEATING SOURCES  (III) AN UPDATE TO THE EXISTING OROGRAPHIC GRAVITY WAVE DRAG PARAMETERIZATION TO INCLUDE EFFECTS OF ANISOTROPY AND LOW-LEVEL WAVE TRAPPING  AND (IV) ANALYSIS OF VALIDATED GLOBAL MODEL EXPERIMENTS TO INFER THE ROLES OF SMALL-SCALE WAVES ON MAJOR MODES OF VARIABILITY AND ON WIND BIASES. THE WORK IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT IN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRECISE ROLES OF SMALL-SCALE WAVES ON CIRCULATION  AND WILL ALSO INFORM THE GMAO S PLANNED FY 2019 TESTS OF A NEW PROTOTYPE GEOS MODEL THROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF A VARIETY OF MODEL SETTING CHOICES ON SMALL-SCALE WAVES AND GRID-SCALE PRECIPITATION.","","2018","$140,485","$0","$140,485","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Washington", "","","","",""

"PREDICTIVE SCIENCE INCORPORATED","","United States","","","","","IN SPITE OF INTENSE STUDY OVER MORE THAN FORTY YEARS  MANY BASIC QUESTIONS ON THE INITIATION AND EVOLUTION OF CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS CMES REMAIN UNSOLVED. THIS PARTICULARLY REFERS TO SYMPATHETIC OR MULTIPLE ERUPTIONS  WHICH OCCUR WITHIN A RELATIVELY SHORT TIME AT DIFFERENT  OFTEN WIDELY SEPARATED  LOCATIONS. PROGRESS IN UNDERSTANDING THESE PHENOMENA HAS BEEN MADE IN RECENT STUDIES OF THE 2010 AUGUST 1-2 CMES SCHRIJVER&TITLE 2011  TO A LARGE EXTENT DUE TO SDO/AIA OBSERVATIONS NOW AVAILABLE. THESE SYMPATHETIC CMES WERE FIRST INVESTIGATED IN OUR IDEALIZED MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC MHD MODEL ET AL. 2011. THE MODEL WAS THEN SUBSTANTIATED TITOV ET AL. 2012 AND CONFIRMED MIKIC ET AL.  2011  2013  USING POTENTIAL FIELD SOURCE SURFACE AND MHD MODELS  RESPECTIVELY  BOTH MORE TIGHTLY CONSTRAINED BY OBSERVATIONS  PARTICULARLY  FROM SOHO MDI AND SDO HMI. THESE STUDIES DEMONSTRATED THAT THE MAGNETIC FLUX TRANSFER BETWEEN DIFFERENT TOPOLOGICAL DOMAINS OF PSEUDO-STREAMER CONFIGURATIONS LIKELY PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN ESTABLISHING A CAUSAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ERUPTIONS AND THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY OCCUR. OUR DEVELOPMENTS PROVIDE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR A MUCH DEEPER STUDY  APPLYING NEW ADVANCED TECHNIQUES THAT WILL ALLOW US TO: I CONSTRUCT PRE-ERUPTIVE EQUILIBRIA WITH MULTIPLE FLUX ROPES TITOV ET AL. 2014 AND II ANALYZE THE 3D TOPOLOGICAL EVOLUTION OF ERUPTING CONFIGURATIONS TITOV 2007 TITOV ET. AL. 2008 TITOV ET AL. 2009.  IN THIS PROPOSAL  WE SEEK TO EMPLOY SUCH TECHNIQUES TO PINPOINT THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH FLUX ROPES CAN ERUPT SYMPATHETICALLY BY INVESTIGATING THE MAGNETIC FLUX TRANSFER IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE EVOLVING MAGNETIC TOPOLOGY IN SUCH ERUPTIONS.","","2018","$152,968","$0","$152,968","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","California", "","","","",""

INVERSE AND FORWARD MODELING WILL BE CARRIED OUT TO INFER DEPTH  LATITUDE  AND TEMPORAL PROPERTIES OF THE MERIDIONAL FLOW OVER A SPAN OF ALMOST TWO SOLAR CYCLES. THE TWO MAIN CHALLENGES TO A RELIABLE DETERMINATION OF THE MERIDIONAL FLOW - NAMELY A POOR SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO AND THE PRESENCE OF SYSTEMATIC ARTIFACTS - WILL BE ADDRESSED BY 1) USING SUFFICIENTLY LONG DATASETS  2) IMPLEMENTING CONTROL MEASUREMENTS  3) PERFORMING COMPARISONS BETWEEN MULTIPLE METHODS AND INSTRUMENTS  AND 4) CARRYING OUT VALIDATION TESTS WITH ARTIFICIAL DATA. OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IS THE IDENTIFICATION AND REMOVAL OF SYSTEMATIC ARTIFACTS WHICH CAN MIMIC LARGE-SCALE FLOWS AND DETRIMENTALLY IMPACT THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LOW-AMPLITUDE MERIDIONAL CIRCULATION. THIS INVESTIGATION IS TIMELY IN THAT THE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES INTO THE SOHO AND SDO MISSIONS IS NOW YIELDING THE DECADES-LONG DATASET REQUIRED FOR THE RELIABLE DETERMINATION OF THE PROPERTIES OF THESE FLOWS.

"LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION","Lockheed Martin","United States","","","","","MAGNETIC FIELDS IN THE ATMOSPHERES OF SUN LIKE STARS ARE THE BRIDGE BETWEEN THE DYNAMO ACTIVITY OCCURRING IN STELLAR INTERIORS AND THEIR OBSERVABLE CHARACTERISTICS. OBSERVATIONAL EVIDENCE OF MAGNETIC FIELDS AND MAGNETIC PROXIES SHOW THAT SUN LIKE STARS SPAN THE GAMUT OF ACTIVITY LEVELS  RANGING FROM EXTREMELY QUIET STARS TO HIGHLY VARIABLE STARS POSSESSING STAR SPOTS OR STAR SPOT GROUPS COVERING A LARGE FRACTION OF THE STELLAR SURFACE. FURTHERMORE  COMPARATIVE STUDIES SHOW THE SUN IS FAR FROM A TYPICAL STAR. IN THIS PROJECT  WE AIM TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING SCIENCE QUESTIONS WHAT CONSTRAINTS CAN MEASUREMENTS OF MAGNETIC SPOTS  DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION  AND FLARES ON OTHER STARS TEACH US ABOUT THE SOLAR DYNAMO WHAT ARE THE LIMITS OF OBSERVATIONAL INFERENCE OF MAGNETIC FIELDS AND DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION ON OTHER STARS WHAT ARE THE CORONAL MAGNETIC CONFIGURATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH SUPER FLARE EVENTS AS OBSERVED  FOR EXAMPLE  IN WHITE LIGHT PHOTOMETRIC DATA IN KEPLER WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF WELL KNOWN PHYSICAL PROCESSES ON THE SUN INCLUDING FLUX EMERGENCE  DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION  TURBULENT DIFFUSION FOR MAGNETIC ACTIVITY ON OTHER STARS WE PROPOSE A FORWARD MODELING FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS. FIRST  WE WILL RUN A SERIES OF SURFACE FLUX TRANSPORT SFT MODELS OF STAR SPOT EVOLUTION. A NUMBER OF THESE MODELS WILL THEN BE USED AS LOWER BOUNDARY CONDITIONS TO DRIVE TIME EVOLVING FORCE FREE MODELS OF THE GLOBAL STELLAR CORONAL FIELD. THE CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELDS ARE EVOLVED BY MAGNETO FRICTION MF  WHICH HAS BEEN APPLIED SUCCESSFULLY FOR MODELING A VARIETY OF SOLAR CORONAL FIELD CONFIGURATIONS  INCLUDING ACTIVE REGIONS AND FILAMENTS. THIS TYPE OF TIME DEPENDENT MODELING WILL ALLOW US TO CONSTRUCT FORCE FREE CORONAL FIELDS EVOLVING IN RESPONSE TO STAR SPOT EVOLUTION.THE COMBINED SFT MF SIMULATIONS WILL BE USED TO PRODUCE SYNTHETIC SPECTROPOLARIMETRIC MEASUREMENTS  WHICH THEN WILL SERVE AS INPUT CONSTRAINTS FOR ZEEMAN DOPPLER IMAGING ZDI INVERSIONS. THE AIM IS TO DETERMINE THE VALIDITY OF THE INVERSIONS  AND TO EXAMINE THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN SUCH INFERRED MAGNETIC PROPERTIES WITH THE INPUT SFT PARAMETERS GOVERNING FLUX EMERGENCE  DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION AND TURBULENT DISPERSAL. PROPERTIES THAT APPEAR IMPORTANT FOR THE SOLAR CASE BUT ARE NOT WELL CONSTRAINED FOR OTHER STARS  SUCH AS LATITUDINAL FLOWS  WILL ALSO BE CONSIDERED. THE BUILDUP OF FREE MAGNETIC ENERGY IN THE MF SIMULATION DOMAIN WILL ALSO BE EVALUATED  AND USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER EVOLUTION ASSOCIATED WITH INTERACTING STAR SPOTS WHICH PRESUMABLY MAY BE MUCH LARGER THAN THE BIGGEST SUNSPOTS MAY BUILD UP SUFFICIENT FREE MAGNETIC ENERGY TO POWER SO CALLED SUPER FLARES SUCH AS THOSE OBSERVED IN KEPLER WHITE LIGHT TIME SERIES DATA.THIS PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO COMPLEMENT OTHER PARTICIPATING PROJECTS IN THE LWS SOLAR STELLAR CONNECTION FOCUS TEAM BY ENABLING OUTPUTS OF DYNAMO MODELS  IN PARTICULAR THOSE THAT PRODUCE TIME VARYING SURFACE FLUX PATTERNS THROUGHOUT SUCCESSIVE STELLAR ACTIVITY CYCLES  TO BE USED FOR ZDI INVERSIONS AND CORONAL MF SIMULATIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

THIS EVOLUTION IS OBSERVED TO TAKE MANY FORMS  RANGING FROM SLOW  GRADUAL ADJUSTMENTS TO MORE DYNAMIC SHIFTS EMBODIED BY FILAMENT ERUPTIONS  FLARES  AND CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS. BECAUSE THE MORPHOLOGIES OF THESE MORE ENERGETIC EVENTS ARE MOST LIKELY INFLUENCED BY THE MAGNETIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH SUCH ACTIVITY IS EMBEDDED  IT IS USEFUL TO STUDY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TOPOLOGY OF THE LARGE-SCALE CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD AND THE OCCURRENCE AND NON-OCCURRENCE OF ERUPTIVE EVENTS. INVESTIGATING THESE RELATIONSHIPS IS EXPECTED TO LEAD TO A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE CORONA EVOLVES AND THE CAPABILITY TO BETTER PREDICT THESE EVENTS. THE LOCATIONS OF TOPOLOGICAL NULL POINTS (WHERE ALL COMPONENTS OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD VANISH) AND SEPARATOR FIELD LINES THAT CONNECT THESE NULL POINTS ARE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST AS THEY ARE THEORIZED TO BE PREFERENTIAL LOCATIONS FOR THE RECONNECTION NEEDED FOR AN ERUPTION TO OCCUR.

"CREW SERVICES LLC","","United States","","","","","DOCUMENTING AND ENABLING IMPROVED  OBSERVATIONALLY BASED  PREDICTIONS OF WATER AND ENERGY CYCLE CONSEQUENCES OF EARTH SYSTEM VARIABILITY AND CHANGE (NEWS GRAND CHALLENGE) REQUIRES AN ACCURATE SPATIAL-TEMPORAL ACCOUNTING OF GLOBAL WATER AND ENERGY CYCLE (WEC) RESERVOIRS AND FLUXES. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL WE MUST CONTINUALLY UPDATE AND IMPROVE THESE FOUNDATIONAL BENCHMARKS USING THE MOST ADVANCED SPACE- AND GROUND-BASED MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS TO SERVE AS A BASELINE FOR STUDIES OF WEC CHANGE AND FOR EVALUATING WEATHER AND CLIMATE PREDICTION MODELS. THEREFORE  THIS PROJECT WILL DESIGN  DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A DYNAMIC STATE OF THE GLOBAL WATER AND ENERGY CYCLE (SWEC) ASSESSMENT BASED ON THE MOST ADVANCED OBSERVATIONS  MODELS AND CONSERVATION CONCEPTS. THE SWEC WILL BUILD ON PREVIOUS NEWS EFFORTS BY DEVELOPING: (A) A MULTI-PRODUCT WEC CLIMATOLOGY MATRIX ACCOUNTING  (B) TIME-SERIES TREND AND VARIABILITY ASSESSMENT  AND (C) REGIONAL WATER AND ENERGY ASSESSMENTS. RATHER THAN TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE  BEST  PRODUCTS FOR A GIVEN WEC GEOPHYSICAL VARIABLE (I.E. PRECIPITATION  EVAPORATION  RADIATION  ETC.)  SWEC WILL STUDY HOW VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF PRODUCTS EFFECT WEC BUDGET CLOSURE AT VARIOUS TIME-SPACE SCALES. SWEC WILL ALSO BE DESIGNED AROUND A DYNAMIC FRAMEWORK - ALLOWING FOR NEW DATASETS TO BE INCLUDED AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE  AND WILL SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE RECENTLY DEVELOPED NASA-MEASURES DATASETS. UNCERTAINTY ESTIMATES FOR EACH ASSESSMENT WILL BE ASSESSED  AND FOLLOWING PREVIOUS NEWS CLIMATOLOGY WORKING GROUP WORK (RODELL ET AL.  2013) MASS/ENERGY CONSERVING WEC ASSESSMENTS WILL BE MADE FOR EACH PRODUCT COMBINATION. SUBSEQUENT ANALYSIS OF THESE INTEGRATED COMPONENTS WILL ALLOW FOR EVALUATION OF OUR CURRENT ABILITY TO DETECT  ANALYZE  UNDERSTAND AND EXPLAIN GLOBAL WEC CHANGE  VARIABILITY  PREDICTION AND PREDICTABILITY. THERE CURRENTLY EXISTS NO ONGOING COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT TO INTEGRATE MODEL  REMOTE-SENSING AND IN-SITU DATASETS INTO AN ASSESSMENT THAT QUANTIFIES THE RATE AND VARIATION OF GLOBAL WATER AND ENERGY CYCLING  SO THE PROPOSED SWEC ASSESSMENT FILLS A CRITICAL GAP IN THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY AND DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTES TO NEWS. INTEGRAL TO THIS EFFORT WILL BE THE ACTIVE COORDINATION OF THE NEWS TEAM; IT IS ONLY THROUGH PROACTIVE COORDINATION BETWEEN NEWS PROJECTS THAT WE CAN INTEGRATE NASA S GLOBAL WEC RESOURCES TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE NEWS CHALLENGE. TO THIS END  I PROPOSE TO HELP COORDINATE THIS TEAM BY SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION FOR NEWS TEAM LEADER. BY CLOSELY COORDINATING THE NEWS TEAM EFFORTS  AND CONDUCTING REGULAR NEWS COMMUNICATIONS  I WILL PROVIDE MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTION TO HELP COORDINATE THE NEWS TEAM EFFORTS TOWARDS ADDRESSING THE NEWS GRAND CHALLENGE. MY LONG ASSOCIATION AND LEADERSHIP OF NEWS  NASA AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS GIVES ME A UNIQUE ABILITY TO SERVE IN THIS ROLE AND ENABLE VALUE-ADDED COORDINATION THAT WILL OPTIMIZE THE NEWS TEAM S INTEGRATION AND CONTRIBUTIONS.","","2018","$174,330","$0","$174,330","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Maryland", "","","","",""

WE WILL EMPLOY ENSEMBLE AVERAGING OF MEASUREMENTS OVER TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SUPERGRANULES TO MINIMIZE NOISE. WE WILL MAKE TRAVEL-TIME MEASUREMENTS OF WAVES WITH A WIDE RANGE OF SKIP-DISTANCE IN ORDER TO SEPARATE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE MEASUREMENTS OF VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL MOTIONS WITHIN THE CONVECTIVE CELLS. 2) WE WILL INFER THE DEPTH VARIATION OF THE ENSEMBLE-AVERAGED SUPERGRANULAR FLOWS USING EXISTING  AND EASILY FINE TUNED  FORWARD MODELS OF THE FLOWS WHICH USE SENSITIVITY FUNCTIONS DERIVED THROUGH AN EMPIRICALLY-BASED SCHEME BASED ON THE BORN APPROXIMATION.

THE OBJECTIVES OF THE ISS MOP PROJECT ARE TO MEASURE PRESENCE OF VIRAL AND SELECT BACTERIAL AND FUNGAL PATHOGENS AND CORRELATE THEIR PRESENCE ON CREW. THE EFFECTS OF THE SPACEFLIGHT ENVIRONMENT ON VIRAL AND MICROBIAL PATHOGEN DYNAMICS ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN AND REPRESENT BOTH A SIGNIFICANT GAP IN OUR KNOWLEDGE AND AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY THE PRESENCE OF MICROBIAL POPULATIONS AND PREDICT HEALTH RISKS DURING LONG TERM SPACE EXPLORATION.  THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE ISS MOP PROJECT IS THAT CERTAIN SHORT LIVING VIRUSES ASSOCIATED WITH INERT ENVIRONMENTAL SPACES IN THE CLOSED HABITAT OF THE ISS CAN HAVE AN ADVERSE INFLUENCE ON CREW HEALTH. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS THE TEAM WILL CATALOGUE VIRUSES ASSOCIATED WITH SURFACES AND AIR OF THE ISS MODULES USING THE ALL ENCOMPASSING LAWRENCE LIVERMORE MICROBIAL DETECTION ARRAY  LLMDA   WHICH CONTAINS PROBES TO DETECT NOT ONLY VIRUSES BUT ALSO CLINICALLY IMPORTANT HUMAN BACTERIAL AND FUNGAL PATHOGENS. IN ADDITION  SKIN AND SALIVA SAMPLES FROM CREWMEMBERS WILL BE REQUESTED TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS.  THERE ARE THREE AIMS PROPOSED IN THIS ISS MOP PROJECT. WHILE THE CULTIVATION BASED ASSAY  AIM 1  PROVIDES A VALID ESTIMATION OF MICROBIAL PRESENCE  IT OFFERS ONLY A LIMITED ASSESSMENT OF THE PHYLOGENETIC PATHOGENIC DIVERSITY AND PHYSIOLOGICAL BREADTH OF THE MICROBIAL POPULATION PRESENT.  THEREFORE  THE TEAM WILL USE THE NOVEL AND COMPREHENSIVE LLMDA MICROARRAY  THAT IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO ELUCIDATE THE PATHOGENIC VIRAL AND MICROBIAL DIVERSITY PROFILES OF COMPLEX SAMPLES TO AT LEAST THE SPECIES LEVEL  AIM 2 . IN ADDITION  WE WILL CHARACTERIZE THE VIRULENCE AND ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE MECHANISMS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PATHOGENS FROM THE ISS BY DEVELOPING A NEW VIRULENCE  AND ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE GENE ARRAY AND ANALYZE THE SAMPLES ON THIS ARRAY. THE FINAL DELIVERABLE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT TO NASA WILL BE THE ISS MOP DATASET  A COMPILATION OF ALL OF THE GENOMIC SEQUENCES AND GENETIC INFORMATION OF VIRUSES AND MICROBES ENCOUNTERED ON AND WITHIN THE ISS HABITAT  AIM 3 .  THE OBJECTIVES OF THE ISS MOP PROJECT DIRECTLY RESPOND TO THE NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL COMMITTEE FOR THE DECADAL SURVEY ON BIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES IN SPACE RECOMMENDATION P1 WHERE IT STATES  TO ESTABLISH A MICROBIAL OBSERVATORY PROGRAM ON THE ISS TO CONDUCT LONG TERM  MULTIGENERATIONAL STUDIES OF MICROBIAL POPULATION DYNAMICS. THE ISS MOP PROJECT WILL ALSO PROVIDE ANSWERS TO NASA SPACE BIOLOGY GUIDING QUESTIONS: HOW DO ALTERATIONS IN GRAVITY AFFECT IN MICROBIAL CELLS  CMM1  ; DOES THE ENHANCED VIRULENCE OR OTHER GENETIC CHANGES OBSERVED WITH MICROBIAL CULTURES FLOWN IN SPACE OCCUR IN OTHER SPECIES  CMM4  ; AND WHAT ARE THE GENETIC CHANGES UNDERLYING PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO SPACE FLIGHT DEMONSTRATED IN BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS  CMM5","","2018","$194,618","$0","$194,618","NASA Space Operations Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.007","","California", "California","USA","joint venture (owned by Bechtel, University of California, Babcock and Wilcox, URS, and Battelle)","miscellaneous services","outsourced government services"

WHILE AES IS WELLSUITED FOR THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF SEARCHING FOR PHENOMENA IN REGULARLY GRIDDED DATA (E.G.  REANALYSES)  TARGETED EXTENSIONS WOULDENABLE A MUCH BROADER CLASS OF EARTH SCIENCE INVESTIGATIONS TO EXPLOIT THE PERFORMANCE AND FLEXIBILITY OF THIS SERVICE. WE PRESENT A RELEVANCY SCENARIO  EVENT-BASED HYDROMETEOROLOGICAL SCIENCE DATA ANALYSIS  WHICH HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR THESE FEATURES THAT WOULD MAXIMIZE THE POTENTIAL OF DERECHOS FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. PROPOSED SOLUTION: WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP DERECHOS  AN EXTENSION OF AES  THAT: (1) GENERALIZES THE UNDERLYING REPRESENTATION TOSUPPORT IRREGULARLY SPACED OBSERVATIONS SUCH AS POINT AND SWATH DATA  (2) INCORPORATES APPROPRIATE RE-GRIDDING AND INTERPOLATION UTILITIES TO ENABLE ANALYSIS ACROSS DATA FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES  (3) INTRODUCES NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION (NDR) TO FACILITATE IDENTIFICATION OF SCIENTIFIC RELATIONSHIPS AMONG HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATASETS  AND (4) INTEGRATES MOVING OBJECT DATABASE TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE TREATMENT OF CONTINUITY FOR THE EVENTS WITH COARSE REPRESENTATION IN TIME. WITH THESE FEATURES  DERECHOS WILL BECOME A POWERFUL ENVIRONMENT THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR A VERY WIDE VARIETY OF EARTH SCIENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS.RESEARCH STRATEGY: DERECHOS WILL BE CREATED BY INTEGRATING VARIOUS SEPARATELY DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES. IN MOST CASES THIS WILL REQUIRE SOME RE-IMPLEMENTATION TO EXPLOIT SCIDB  THE UNDERLYING DATABASE THAT HAS STRONG SUPPORT FOR MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCIENTIFIC DATA. WHERE POSSIBLE  SYNTHETIC DATA/INPUTS WILL BE GENERATED TO FACILITATE INDEPENDENT TESTING OF NEW COMPONENTS. A SCIENTIFIC USE CASEWILL BE USED TO DERIVE SPECIFIC INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS AND TO DEMONSTRATE INTEGRATION SUCCESS. SIGNIFICANCE: FRESHWATER RESOURCES ARE PREDICTED TO BE A MAJOR FOCUS OF CONTENTION AND CONFLICT IN THE 21ST CENTURY. THUS HYDROMETEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY COMMUNITIES ARE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTED BY THE SUPERIOR RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH AES  WHICH HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED FOR TWO REAL-WORLD USE CASES.

"REFLECTIVE X-RAY OPTICS LLC","","United States","","","","","THE OVERARCHING CHALLENGE ADDRESSED BY THIS PROPOSAL IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH-REFLECTANCE  HIGH-RESOLUTION X-RAY MIRRORS  TO BE USED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF LIGHTWEIGHT X-RAY TELESCOPES FOR FUTURE NASA ASTRONOMY MISSIONS SUCH AS LYNX AND OTHERS. THE PROPOSAL'S TWO SPECIFIC AIMS ARE: 1) THE DEVELOPMENT OF OPTIMIZED IRIDIUM-BASED INTERFERENCE COATINGS FOR THE 0.1 10 KEV BAND; AND 2) THE DEVELOPMENT OF METHODS TO MITIGATE COATING-STRESS-INDUCED SUBSTRATE DEFORMATIONS IN THIN-SHELL GLASS AND SI MIRROR SEGMENTS. THESE GOALS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY BUILDING ON ESTABLISHED FILM DEPOSITION TECHNIQUES AND METROLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE FOR X-RAY OPTICS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND ADVANCED BY THE PI THROUGH APRA FUNDING SINCE 1999. SPECIFIC AIM #1: INTERFERENCE COATINGS FOR THE 0.1 10 KEV ENERGY BAND TELESCOPE EFFECTIVE AREA CAN BE MAXIMIZED BY USING IR-BASED REFLECTIVE COATINGS THAT EXPLOIT OPTICAL INTERFERENCE TO PROVIDE HIGHER REFLECTANCE THAN IR ALONE. HOWEVER  ONLY PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS OF SUCH COATINGS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED THUS FAR; MORE RESEARCH IS REQUIRED TO FULLY OPTIMIZE THESE COATINGS FOR MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE  TO EXPERIMENTALLY DETERMINE THE COATING DESIGNS THAT ARE FEASIBLE  AND TO DETERMINE THE ACHIEVABLE X-RAY REFLECTANCE  FILM STRESS  SURFACE ROUGHNESS  AND THERMAL AND TEMPORAL STABILITY. THE FIRST SPECIFIC AIM OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO REACH THESE VERY GOALS THROUGH A COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH PROGRAM. DEMONSTRATION OF THE ACHIEVABLE REFLECTANCE  STRESS  AND ROUGHNESS IN STABLE  OPTIMIZED COATINGS WILL IN TURN FACILITATE GLOBAL TELESCOPE DESIGN OPTIMIZATION  BY IDENTIFYING THE BEST COATING FOR EACH MIRROR SHELL BASED ON INCIDENCE ANGLE  AND ON TELESCOPE EFFECTIVE-AREA AND FIELD-OF-VIEW REQUIREMENTS. THE RESEARCH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GREATLY INCREASE THE EFFECTIVE AREA OF FUTURE X-RAY TELESCOPES. SPECIFIC AIM #2: MITIGATION OF COATING-STRESS-INDUCED SUBSTRATE DEFORMATIONS HIGH-QUALITY FILMS OF IR AND OTHER CANDIDATE MATERIALS (E.G.  B4C) TO BE INVESTIGATED FOR THE 0.1 10 KEV BAND DEPOSITED BY MAGNETRON SPUTTERING HAVE HIGH DENSITY AND LOW ROUGHNESS  AND THUS GOOD X-RAY PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER IR  B4C  AND CERTAIN OTHER MATERIALS HAVE EXCEEDINGLY HIGH FILM STRESS WHEN DEPOSITED UNDER CONDITIONS FOR MAXIMUM REFLECTANCE. RESIDUAL FILM STRESS IN THE X-RAY REFLECTIVE COATINGS CAN DEFORM THIN-SHELL MIRROR SEGMENTS  LEADING TO UNACCEPTABLE DEGRADATION OF ANGULAR RESOLUTION. COATING STRESS WAS NOT AN ISSUE FOR CHANDRA. BUT FOR LYNX  FOR EXAMPLE  THE SUBSTRATES WILL BE ~50X THINNER  AND SO SUB-ARC-SECOND RESOLUTION SIMPLY CANNOT BE ACHIEVED USING THIN-SHELL MIRROR SEGMENTS WITHOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF NON-DEFORMING COATINGS. THE SECOND SPECIFIC AIM OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP TECHNIQUES TO MITIGATE COATING-STRESS-INDUCED DEFORMATIONS IN GLASS AND SI SHELL SEGMENTS. TWO POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS WILL BE INVESTIGATED: A) NEW DEPOSITION METHODS TO CONTROL COATING THICKNESS UNIFORMITY AND NET FILM STRESS IN TWO DIMENSIONS WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE IF ALREADY-DEVELOPED ZERO-NET-STRESS IR-BASED COATINGS  AS WELL AS THE NEW REFLECTIVE COATINGS TO BE DEVELOPED  CAN BE DEPOSITED ONTO SHELL SEGMENTS WITHOUT INDUCING UNACCEPTABLE SUBSTRATE DEFORMATIONS  A QUESTION THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN DEFINITIVELY ADDRESSED; IF UNIFORM COATINGS HAVING SUFFICIENTLY LOW DEFORMATION CANNOT BE REALIZED  THEN NON-UNIFORM COATINGS WILL BE INVESTIGATED  WHERE SPATIAL CONTROL OF NET FILM STRESS IN 2D WILL COMPENSATE FOR POTENTIAL NON-UNIFORM DEFORMATIONS. IF SUCCESSFUL  THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE APPROACH WITH MORE COMPLEX INTERFERENCE COATINGS WILL ALSO BE ESTABLISHED. B) A MORE GENERAL (ALBEIT MORE COMPLEX) METHOD OF MITIGATING STRESS-INDUCED DEFORMATIONS WILL BE INVESTIGATED  SPECIFICALLY THE USE OF BALANCED FRONT- AND BACKSIDE COATINGS  A TECHNIQUE THAT  IF SUCCESSFUL  CAN BE USED  IN PRINCIPLE  WITH ANY TYPE OF COATING (IR-BASED  HIGH-ENERGY MULTILAYERS  ETC.)  REGARDLESS OF ITS STRESS STATE.

"AEOLIS RESEARCH  INC.","","United States","","","","","THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW SURFACE SOURCES AND SINKS OF WATER AT THE MARTIAN POLES INTERACT WITH THE GLOBAL CLIMATE SYSTEM. THE PROPOSAL WILL PRIMARILY USE DATA PRODUCTS FROM CRISM  MCS AND MARCI ABOARD MRO. A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION OF THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE IN THE THERMAL AND METEOROLOGICAL MODELING ""NECESSARY TO ANALYZE OR INTERPRET THE DATA"" IN TERMS OF THE WATER AND DUST CYCLES. THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO ADDRESS FOUR MAJOR QUESTIONS: - HOW IS THE LOCAL CYCLE OF WATER (AND DUST) CONTROLLED AT SITES OBSERVED BY CRISM/MCS/MARCI? - CAN SUCH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTROLS ON SURFACE WATER EXCHANGE BE SUMMARIZED INTO A PROGNOSTIC FRAMEWORK LIKE A LAND SURFACE MODEL (LSM) IN TERRESTRIAL STUDIES? - HOW IS THE GLOBAL CYCLE OF WATER AND DUST CHANGED IF BETTER REPRESENTATIONS OF THE POLAR EXCHANGE PROCESSES ARE INCLUDED IN GLOBAL MODELS? - CAN THE SEASONAL PROGNOSTIC PICTURE OF ICE AND DUST DEPOSITION AT THE POLES BE USED TO HELP UNDERSTAND THE FORMATION OF POLAR LAYERED TERRAIN? THE LATTER QUESTION SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE MDAP CALL REGARDING ""NONDATA-ANALYSIS TASKS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE USE OR FACILITATE THE INTERPRETATION OF MISSION DATA"" AS IT ALLOWS DATA ON CURRENT PROCESSES TO BE USED TO ADDRESS LONGER-TERM QUESTIONS IN MARTIAN CLIMATE DYNAMICS AND GEOLOGY. THE WATER CYCLE IS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE MARTIAN CLIMATE SYSTEM  YIELDING A SIGNIFICANT FEEDBACK ON THE CLIMATE THROUGH ITS EFFECTS ON SURFACE ALBEDO VIA FORMATION OF ICES AND ON ATMOSPHERIC EMISSIVITY AND REFLECTIVITY VIA CLOUDS. CLOUDS ALSO INTERACT WITH THE ATMOSPHERIC DUST DISTRIBUTION VIA THE MICROPHYSICS OF CLOUD PARTICLE EVOLUTION  YIELDING ADDITIONAL MODIFICATION OF ATMOSPHERIC RADIATIVE FORCING. WHILE THE MAJOR PROCESSES OF THE WATER CYCLE  AND ITS INTERACTIONS WITH THE DUST AND CO2 CYCLES  HAVE BEEN SKETCHED IN OUTLINE FOR SEVERAL DECADES  THE SPECIFICS OF HOW THE WATER CYCLE IS CONTROLLED REMAIN UNCERTAIN  E.G. THE IMPORTANCE OF REGOLITH EXCHANGE. THE NATURE OF THE NORTHERN CAP AS A DOMINANT WATER SOURCE AND THAT OF BOTH THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH AS SINKS AGAIN SEEMS CERTAIN IN OUTLINE  BUT THE DETAILS OF HOW THESE SOURCES AND SINKS FUNCTION HAS NOT RECEIVED MUCH ATTENTION AND MAY DOMINATE THE EFFICACY OF HOW THE WATER (AND RELATED CLIMATE) CYCLES ARE CONTROLLED GLOBALLY. CRISM DATA SUGGEST SIGNIFICANT LOCAL CYCLING AND IN SOME CASES BURIAL OF ANNUAL WATER LAYERS  WHICH IS LIKELY THE BASIS FOR POLAR LAYER FORMATION  AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHICH WOULD BE KEY TO UNRAVELING THE RECORD OF CLIMATE STORED IN THESE LAYERS. WE PROPOSE TO USE THE PLANETWRF MODELING SYSTEM TO UNDERTAKE IDEALIZED LOCAL THERMAL / WATER EXCHANGE MODELING OF SPECIFIC SITES OBSERVED BY CRISM  TO UNDERTAKE RESOLVED-SCALE SEASONAL MODELING OF THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CAPS  AND TO UNDERTAKE MULTI-ANNUAL MODELING OF THE CLIMATE SYSTEM USING LSM SCHEMES DEVELOPED WITHIN THIS PROJECT. NEW DATA PRODUCTS FROM CRISM WILL BE DEVELOPED AS NEEDED WITHIN THE ANALYSIS. THIS PROPOSAL IS RELEVANT TO THE MARS DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAM AS IT SEEKS TO UNDERTAKE WORK NECESSARY FOR THE ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF MARS SPACECRAFT MISSION DATA AND WILL HEAVILY USE MISSION DATA IN THE GENERATION OF IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF THE MARTIAN CLIMATE SYSTEM. IT WILL ALSO IMPROVE ATMOSPHERIC MODELS THAT FURTHER THE UNDERSTANDING AND FORECASTING OF ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT SAFE PASSAGE OF SPACECRAFT THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE. COLUMN WATER VAPOR ABUNDANCES RETRIEVED FROM CRISM SPECTRA WILL BE ARCHIVED AT NASA'S PDS ATMOSPHERES NODE.

"AEOLIS RESEARCH  INC.","","United States","","","","","THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO INVESTIGATE THE PROCESSES ON TITAN CONTROLLING (1) THE ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION  (2) THE METHANE CYCLE  AND (3) THE ACTION OF WIND AT THE SURFACE. THEORETICAL  ANALYTICAL OR SIMPLIFIED (E.G. 2D) MODELS PROVIDE A POWERFUL MEANS OF INVESTIGATING SPECIFIC PHENOMENA IN TITAN'S ATMOSPHERE  AND ENABLE HYPOTHESES TO BE FORMED CONCERNING THE RELEVANT MECHANISMS AT WORK.HOWEVER  REAL ATMOSPHERES ARE COMPLICATED BY THREE-DIMENSIONAL PROCESSES  NON-LINEAR INTERACTIONS  AND NUMEROUS FEEDBACKS. THREE-DIMENSIONAL GENERAL CIRCULATION MODELS (GCMS) PROVIDE AN INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK FOR CAPTURING THE LINEAR AND NON-LINEAR INTERACTIONS OF A WIDE RANGE OF PROCESSES  AND ARE THUS REQUIRED TO TEST AND FURTHER DEVELOP HYPOTHESES  TO STUDY THE COMPLETE ATMOSPHERIC SYSTEM  AND TO SIMULATE (AND EVENTUALLY PREDICT) ALL ASPECTS OF THE TIME-VARYING 3D ATMOSPHERE. DESPITE THEIR USEFULNESS  HOWEVER  GCMS (AND PARTICULARLY PLANETARY GCMS) CONTAIN MANY UNKNOWN OR POORLY KNOWN ASSUMPTIONSAND PARAMETERS. A TITAN GCM THEREFORE CANNOT HOPE TO PROPERLY REPRESENT ITS INTENDED ATMOSPHERE UNTIL IT HAS BEEN CONFRONTED WITH SUFFICIENT OBSERVATIONS TO CONSTRAIN THESE PROPERLY  AND IT CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY (BY WHICH WE MEAN WITHIN A SINGLE SIMULATION) MATCH MULTI-INSTRUMENT OBSERVATIONS OF DISPARATE VARIABLES AND FEATURES. IN THIS WORK WE PROPOSE TO CONSTRAIN OUR EXISTING THREE-DIMENSIONALGCM TITANWRF IN THE THREE AREAS DESCRIBED ABOVE. FOR (1) WE WILL DEVELOP AN OBSERVATION SYSTEM SIMULATION EXPERIMENT FOR THE CASSINI CIRS INSTRUMENT  USING IT TO COMPARE CIRS RADIANCES WITH TITANWRF PREDICTIONS  AND TO ASSESS WHETHER OBSERVATIONS SUPPORT THE EXISTENCE AND NATURE OF THE WAVE DRIVEN ANGULAR MOMENTUM TRANSFER EVENTS THAT ARE KEY TO PRODUCING STRATOSPHERIC SUPERROTATION IN TITANWRF. FOR (2) WE WILL ADD NEW PARAMETERIZATIONS OF METHANE CYCLE PROCESSES (INCLUDING MOIST CONVECTION AND SUB-SURFACE DIFFUSION) AND VARY TITANWRF'S PHYSICAL PARAMETERS  WITH THE AIM OF PRODUCING THE BEST MATCH TO THE OBSERVED METHANE CYCLE. FOR (3) WE WILL USE REALISTIC TOPOGRAPHY TO PREDICT GLOBAL AND MESOSCALE DUNE CHARACTERISTICS BASED ON THE LONG-TERM WIND FIELD  PROVIDING AN INDIRECT BUT RIGOROUS MEANS OF TESTING THE NEAR-SURFACE ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION PREDICTED BY TITANWRF  CONSTRAINING THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE WINDS (FROM SURFACE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS TO PHYSICAL PROCESSES)  AND INVESTIGATING MECHANISMS BEHIND THE OBSERVED CHARACTERISTICS OF TITAN'S DUNES. AS WE REQUIRE TITANWRF TO SIMULTANEOUSLY MATCH OBSERVATIONS IN ALL THREE AREAS  RESULTS OF EACH INVESTIGATION WILL GUIDE WORK IN THE OTHERS  AND OUTPUT FROM OUR EVENTUAL `MOST REALISTIC' GCM ENCAPSULATING OUR BEST UNDERSTANDING OF TITAN WILL BE MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE VIA THE PLANETARY DATA SYSTEM (PDS) FOR WIDER COMMUNITY USE.","","2018","$205,530","$0","$205,530","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","California", "","","","",""

"PREDICTIVE SCIENCE INCORPORATED","","United States","","","","","USING EUV WAVES TO PROBE THE SOLAR CORONA SDO/AIA OBSERVATIONS OF LARGE-SCALE CORONAL WAVES (EUV WAVES) TRIGGERED BY CMES PROVIDE A TANTALIZING AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE DYNAMICS OF SOLAR ERUPTIONS AND THE AMBIENT PLASMA STATE OF THE SOLAR CORONA. WHILE MUCH PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE DURING THE LIFETIME OF THE SDO/AIA MISSION  MANY QUESTIONS REMAIN ABOUT THE PHYSICAL NATURE OF EUV WAVES AND THE MYRIAD OF ASSOCIATED FINE-SCALE STRUCTURES THAT ARE NOW OBSERVED. SIMILARLY  HARNESSING THE POTENTIAL OF USING EUV WAVES TO MAKE SEISMOLOGICAL ESTIMATES OF MAGNETIC FIELD AND/OR PLASMA PARAMETERS REMAINS DIFFICULT  DUE IN PART TO THE AD-HOC OR SIMPLIFYING ASSUMPTIONS OFTEN REQUIRED FOR THEIR INTERPRETATION. IN THIS CONTEXT  WE PROPOSE TO IMPROVE UPON CURRENT METHODS USED FOR ANALYZING AND UNDERSTANDING EUV WAVES. WE WILL TACKLE THIS PROBLEM USING A COUPLED OBSERVATIONAL ANALYSIS AND MODELING APPROACH. THIS INVOLVES USING A STATE-OF-THE-ART MHD MODEL TO SYSTEMATICALLY COUPLE THE PHYSICAL MECHANISMS OF LARGE-SCALE TRANSIENTS GENERATED BY ERUPTIONS DIRECTLY TO OBSERVABLES AVAILABLE FROM SDO/AIA. OUR STUDY WILL CAPITALIZE ON THE RICH  HIGH CADENCE MULTI-FILTER DATASETS PROVIDED BY SDO/AIA  AS WELL AS RECENT MHD MODELING DEVELOPMENTS THAT ALLOW US TO SIMULATE SOLAR ERUPTIONS FOR OBSERVED CONFIGURATIONS IN A GLOBAL CORONAL MODEL. IN PRACTICE  THIS EFFORT WILL INVOLVE TWO MAJOR ARCS: A) A SERIES OF ERUPTION EXPERIMENTS WHICH ALLOW US TO ISOLATE AND STUDY SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF EUV WAVES. A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THIS EFFORT WILL BE THE EXPRESS DEVELOPMENT AND REFINEMENT OF METHODS THAT CAN BE USED FOR THE INVERSE PROBLEM  I.E. CONVERTING PERTURBATIONS OF THE OBSERVABLES INTO MEANINGFUL INSIGHT ON THE CHANGING MAGNETIC AND PLASMA STATE OF THE CORONA. WE EXPECT THE OUTPUT OF THESE EXPERIMENTS TO BE BROADLY APPLICABLE TO A LARGE-NUMBER OF EVENTS OBSERVED BY SDO/AIA. B) CASE STUDIES OF SELECTED SOLAR ERUPTIONS OBSERVED BY SDO/AIA. HERE WE WILL EXPLICITLY MODEL THE THERMAL-MAGNETIC STATE OF THE ENTIRE CORONA BEFORE AND DURING THE ERUPTION  BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT WAS OBSERVED AND THE UNDERLYING PHYSICAL EVOLUTION. THESE STUDIES WILL ALSO AID IN CHARACTERIZING THE METHODS DEVELOPED IN THE FIRST EFFORT. THE CRUX OF THIS INVESTIGATION IS THE SYNTHESIS OF MODEL RESULTS IN TERMS OF AIA OBSERVABLES AND THEIR DIRECT COMPARISON TO AVAILABLE OBSERVATIONAL DATA. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS COUPLED APPROACH IS A UNIQUE AND COMPLIMENTARY WAY TO HARNESS THE SCIENTIFIC POTENTIAL OF THE SDO/AIA INSTRUMENT  AND IS THEREFORE RELEVANT TO THE GOALS OF THE NASA LWS PROGRAM.","","2018","$209,693","$0","$209,693","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","California", "","","","",""

"PREDICTIVE SCIENCE INCORPORATED","","United States","","","","","IN SPITE OF INTENSE STUDY OVER MORE THAN FORTY YEARS  MANY BASIC QUESTIONS ON THE INITIATION AND EVOLUTION OF CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS (CMES) REMAIN UNSOLVED. THIS PARTICULARLY REFERS TO SYMPATHETIC OR MULTIPLE ERUPTIONS  WHICH OCCUR WITHIN A RELATIVELY SHORT TIME AT DIFFERENT  OFTEN WIDELY SEPARATED  LOCATIONS. PROGRESS IN UNDERSTANDING THESE PHENOMENA HAS BEEN MADE IN RECENT STUDIES OF THE 2010 AUGUST 1-2 CMES (SCHRIJVER&TITLE 2011)  TO A LARGE EXTENT DUE TO SDO/AIA OBSERVATIONS NOW AVAILABLE. THESE SYMPATHETIC CMES WERE FIRST INVESTIGATED IN OUR IDEALIZED MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC (MHD) MODEL (T R K ET AL. 2011). THE MODEL WAS THEN SUBSTANTIATED (TITOV ET AL. 2012) AND CONFIRMED (MIKIC ET AL.  2011  2013)  USING POTENTIAL FIELD SOURCE SURFACE AND MHD MODELS  RESPECTIVELY  BOTH MORE TIGHTLY CONSTRAINED BY OBSERVATIONS  PARTICULARLY  FROM SOHO/MDI AND SDO/HMI. THESE STUDIES DEMONSTRATED THAT THE MAGNETIC FLUX TRANSFER BETWEEN DIFFERENT TOPOLOGICAL DOMAINS OF PSEUDO-STREAMER CONFIGURATIONS LIKELY PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN ESTABLISHING A CAUSAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ERUPTIONS AND THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY OCCUR. OUR DEVELOPMENTS PROVIDE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR A MUCH DEEPER STUDY  APPLYING NEW ADVANCED TECHNIQUES THAT WILL ALLOW US TO: (I) CONSTRUCT PRE-ERUPTIVE EQUILIBRIA WITH MULTIPLE FLUX ROPES (TITOV ET AL. 2014) AND (II) ANALYZE THE 3D TOPOLOGICAL EVOLUTION OF ERUPTING CONFIGURATIONS (TITOV 2007; TITOV ET. AL. 2008; TITOV ET AL. 2009). IN THIS PROPOSAL  WE SEEK TO EMPLOY SUCH TECHNIQUES TO PINPOINT THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH FLUX ROPES CAN ERUPT SYMPATHETICALLY BY INVESTIGATING THE MAGNETIC FLUX TRANSFER IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE EVOLVING MAGNETIC TOPOLOGY IN SUCH ERUPTIONS.","","2018","$212,478","$0","$212,478","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","California", "","","","",""

"ATMOSPHERIC & SPACE TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH ASSOCIATES","","United States","","","","","THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO STUDY THE TIME DEPENDENT NEUTRAL CHEMISTRY AND TRANSPORT OF WATER IN THE MESOSPHERE AND LOWER THERMOSPHERE MLT AND TO DETERMINE THE RESULTANT IMPACT ON THE LOCAL TEMPERATURE AND ICE CLOUD FORMATION. TO REACH THIS GOAL  WE WILL ANSWER THREE SCIENCE QUESTIONS1. WHAT IS THE ENERGETIC AND CHEMICAL RESPONSE OF THE UPPER MESOSPHERE AND LOWER THERMOSPHERE TO WATER DEPOSITED IN THE LOWER THERMOSPHERE?2. HOW DOES THE INJECTION OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER VAPOR CHANGE THE THERMODYNAMICS AND IMPACT THE PHYSICS OF PMC FORMATION?3. HOW IS THE WATER VAPOR THAT GETS INJECTED INTO THE LOWER THERMOSPHERE  REDISTRIBUTED VERTICALLY TO THE PMC REGION NEAR 82 KM?TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS WE PROPOSE TO RELEASE A PLUME OF WATER VAPOR AT HIGH LATITUDES FROM A ROCKET PAYLOAD AND OBSERVE HOW THE ATMOSPHERE RESPONDS BOTH DURING AND AFTER THE RELEASE. WE WILL OBSERVE THE EVOLUTION OF THE PLUME OF WATER WITH LIDAR MEASUREMENTS FROM POKER FLAT RESEARCH RANGE PFRR. THE LIDAR IS CAPABLE OF TRACKING BOTH THE OPTICAL EMISSIONS FROM THE REGION AND MEASURING THE TEMPERATURE PROFILES. IN ADDITION  AN ADVANCED MESOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE MAPPER AMTM INSTRUMENT WILL BE DEPLOYED ATPFRR TO OBSERVE THE UPPER MESOSPHERE 87 KM BEFORE AND DURING THE WATER RELEASE TO PROVIDE QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION ON ANY DYNAMICS WAVE ACTIVITY AND CHANGES IN MESOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE. THE COMBINATION OF THE LIDAR AND MAPPING IMAGER THUS PROVIDES STRONG GROUND BASED DIAGNOSTICS FOR THE LAUNCH. THE LAUNCH WILL BE AT TWILIGHT SO THAT ANY FORMATION OF PMCS FROM THE PLUME WILL BEVISIBLE FROM THE GROUND. TRIMETHYL ALUMINUM TMA TRAILS WILL BE RELEASED IN ADDITION TO THE WATER FROM A SEPARATE PAYLOAD CANISTER. THE TMA IS CHEMILUMINESCENT AND CAN BE TRACKED OPTICALLY FROM THE GROUND WITH CAMERAS AND THE NAKED EYE. THE MOVEMENT OF THE TMA TRAILS WILL THUS PROVIDE A DIRECT INDICATION OF HOW THE WATER IS MOVING SINCE BOTH WILL BE TRANSPORTED BY THE BACKGROUND WINDS. THE TMAMEASUREMENTS WILL BE HELPFUL BOTH FOR REAL TIME WAATER CLOUD TRACKING AND FOR POST FLIGHT ANALYSIS. OUR GROUND BASED OBSERVATIONS WILL BE SUPPORTED BY OBSERVATIONS FROM THE NASA TIMED AND AIM MISSIONS AND MODELING RESULT FROM THE THERMOSPHERE IONOSPHERE MESOSPHERE ENERGETICS GENERAL CIRCULATION MODEL TIMEGCM. WE WILL INTERPRET THE OBSERVATIONS OF PMCS AND TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS FROM THE TIMED SATELLITE THAT ARE DRIVEN BY THE PLUME CHEMISTRY WITH OUR TIMEGCM MODEL. THE TIMEGCM WILL BE AUGMENTED TO INCLUDE ALL HEATING AND COOLING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE PLUME WATER VAPOR  ANY RESULTANT ICE FORMATION AS WELL AS VERTICAL TRANSPORT AND HEATING OF THE AMBIENT ATMOSPHERE BY THE ICE. MODEL RESULTS WILL BE COMPARED WITH OBSERVED PMC DATA FROM AIM AND CORRESPONDING TIMED SABER TEMPERATURES TO ELUCIDATE AND UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PMCS AND BULK THERMODYNAMICS.PERCEIVED SIGNIFICANCE THE PROPOSED PROJECT DEALS WITH A SCIENCE INVESTIGATION THAT CAN BE CARRIED OUT WITH INSTRUMENTS FLOWN ON SUBORBITAL SOUNDING ROCKETS. IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE SCIENCE GOAL OF UNDERSTANDING THE FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL PROCESSES OF THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT 2010 SCIENCE PLAN FOR NASA SMD. THE PROPOSAL IS ALSO RELEVANT TO THE NASA HELIOPHYSICS ROADMAP  INCLUDING TWOOUT OF THREE OVERARCHING OBJECTIVES OPEN THE FRONTIERS TO SPACE ENVIRONMENT PREDICTION  AND UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF OUR HOME IN SPACE AND THEIR ASSOCIATED RESEARCH FOCUS AREAS. IT ALSO COMPLEMENTS WORK PERFORMED UNDER THE NASA AIM AND TIMED MISSIONS.","","2018","$234,562","$0","$234,562","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Colorado", "","","","",""

"GROUP FOR ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS  INC.  THE","","United States","","","","","THE SUCCESS OF FUTURE LONG DURATION EXPLORATION MISSIONS (LDEM) IS LIKELY TO BE CONTINGENT ON THE CREW S ABILITY TO ADJUST IN RESPONSE TO ENVIRONMENT DEMANDS. THERE HAS BEEN RECENT INTEREST IN TEAM ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY  BUT RESEARCHERS HAVE NOTED THE NEED TO CLARIFY THOSE CONSTRUCTS. WE PROPOSE A PROGRAM OF RESEARCH TO: A) CLARIFY AND BETTER UNDERSTAND THESE CONSTRUCTS  IN PARTICULAR WITH HOW THEY OPERATE IN ISOLATED  CONFINED  AND EXTREME (ICE) ENVIRONMENTS AND B) BASED ON THAT ENHANCED UNDERSTANDING  DEVELOP AND TEST TARGETED COUNTERMEASURES DESIGNED TO BOOST THE ADAPTABILITY AND RESILIENCE OF LDEM CREWS. WORK CONDUCTED BY MAYNARD AND COLLEAGUES (2015)  SUPPLEMENTED BY THE TEAM RESILIENCE WORK OF ALLIGER ET AL. (IN PRESS)   ALL MEMBERS OF OUR RESEARCH TEAM   PROVIDES A  ROAD MAP  FOR THE PROPOSED RESEARCH. WE WILL FIRST EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL TRIGGERS ON TEAM ADAPTATION  INCORPORATING AN EVENT TAXONOMY AND CATEGORIZATION SCHEMA WITH WHICH TO ASSESS EXPERIENCES AND TRIGGER EVENTS. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO INDEX THE TYPES OF CHALLENGES THAT LDEM CREWS WILL CONFRONT. WE WILL TEST A SERIES OF RELATED HYPOTHESES USING ARCHIVAL DATA WE COLLECTED IN PRIOR RESEARCH IN THE HERA HABITAT. WE WILL THEN EXAMINE ANTECEDENTS AND OUTCOMES OF ADAPTATION  GATHERING DATA IN TWO ANALOG ENVIRONMENTS. FINALLY  BASED ON THE THEORETICAL AND PRELIMINARY EMPIRICAL WORK  WE WILL DEVELOP TEAM COUNTERMEASURES DESIGNED TO PROMOTE CONSTRUCTIVE TEAM ADAPTATION AND TEAM RESILIENCE  AND DURING YEARS 2 AND 3  TEST THOSE COUNTERMEASURES IN ANALOG ENVIRONMENTS. ONE OF OUR TEST ENVIRONMENTS WILL BE A FIELD SETTING THAT INVOLVES TEAMS THAT WORK IN ICE CONDITIONS IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY.

"PIEDRA - SOMBRA CORPORATION  INC.","","United States","","","","","SUBSURFACE EXPLORATION OF OCEAN WORLDS ULTIMATELY REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT ICE PENETRATION. WE PROPOSE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF AN ENTIRELY NOVEL ICE PENETRATING TECHNOLOGY  USING LASER LIGHT CARRIED BY AN OPTICAL FIBER TETHER AND EMITTED FROM THE PROBE S NOSE CONE DIRECTLY INTO THE ICE. THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS CRITICAL BENEFITS OVER CONVENTIONAL HOT POINT MELT PROBES AND MECHANICAL DRILLS AND IS PARTICULARLY ADVANTAGEOUS FOR THE EXTREME COLD AND VACUUM ENVIRONMENT ON OCEAN WORLDS. CURRENTLY OUR DIRECT LASER PROBE IS TARGETED FOR VERY EFFICIENT PENETRATION OF 1 TO 10 METERS DEPTH AND SCALES WELL FOR PENETRATION OF 10S TO 100S OF METERS. PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED AT STONE AEROSPACE OVER A RANGE OF POWER LEVELS AND ICE PENETRATION RATES PRODUCED EXCELLENT RESULTS EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS (TRL 3) AND ACHIEVING THE FASTEST RECORDED CRYOBOT DESCENT SPEED TO DATE. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP  BUILD  AND CHARACTERIZE A DIRECT-LASER-BASED PENETRATOR SYSTEM  REFINING AND ADVANCING THIS TECHNOLOGY TO TRL 5. WE WILL TEST A RANGE OF PROBE DIAMETERS AND LASER POWER LEVELS UNDER RELEVANT EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY  WE WILL INVESTIGATE FIBER-COUPLED OPTICAL BIOMARKER SENSORS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LASER S FIBER OPTIC TETHER. CONVENTIONAL HOT POINT MELT PROBES TESTED UNDER VACUUM HAVE SHOWN EXTREME DIFFICULTY INITIATING PENETRATION (KAUFMANN  ET AL. 2009)  AS THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO THERMAL CONTACT BETWEEN THE PROBE NOSE AND ROUGH ICE SURFACE. THE ICE SIMPLY SUBLIMATES AND ANY TRANSFERRED HEAT IS QUICKLY DISSIPATED DUE TO THE LOW POWER DENSITY AND EXTREME COLD. WITH DIRECT LASER HEATING  NO THERMAL CONTACT IS NEEDED  AND 100% OF THE LASER POWER IS DEPOSITED DIRECTLY INTO THE ICE WITH NO THERMAL HANDLING LOSSES. FURTHERMORE  1070 NM RADIATION HAS GREATER ABSORPTION IN ICE THAN IN WATER  WHICH LIMITS ATTENUATION THROUGH ANY WATER POCKET IN FRONT OF THE PROBE. HIGHER POWER DENSITIES AND FASTER CRYOBOT PENETRATION TIMES ARE NOW MADE POSSIBLE  WHICH IS CRITICAL BECAUSE PROBE EFFICIENCY CLIMBS DRAMATICALLY AT HIGHER SPEEDS BY AVOIDING EXTREME CONDUCTIVE LOSSES IN COLD ICE. A MAJOR BENEFIT OF DEPOSITING ENERGY INTO A VOLUME OF ICE  RATHER THAN UPON A SURFACE  IS A LOWER RESULTING TEMPERATURE FOR SAMPLING COMPARED TO HOT POINT PROBES  WHICH MUST GENERATE LARGE TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS TO FORCE THE HEAT THROUGH LAYERS OF ICE AND WATER. DURING PROOF OF CONCEPT TESTING  WE OBSERVED ONLY MODERATE TEMPERATURE RISES AT THE ICE-WATER INTERFACE  IMPLYING THAT SAMPLES WILL NOT BE EXCESSIVELY HEATED. ANOTHER ADVANTAGE TO THIS LASER APPROACH IS THAT THE PROBE S FIBER OPTIC TETHER  ALONG WITH A DEDICATED SENSOR FIBER  ENABLE A FORM OF ""OPTICAL ACCESS"" TO THE SUBSURFACE ENVIRONMENT. THIS ACCESS CAN BE UTILIZED BY A LANDER S ON-BOARD INSTRUMENTS (RAMAN SPECTROMETER  ETC.) OR INSTRUMENTS DEDICATED TO THE PENETRATOR (FIBER SPECTROMETER  EM SENSOR FOR LIGHT SPECTRUM  ETC). THESE SENSORS CAN SEARCH FOR BIOMARKERS AND CHARACTERIZE THE RADIATION/LIGHT ENVIRONMENT FOR SUBSURFACE HABITABILITY  INCLUDING PHOTOSYNTHETIC POTENTIAL AND RADIATION ENVIRONMENT AS A SOURCE FOR ENERGY AND DAMAGE. THIS COMBINATION LASER PENETRATOR AND INTEGRATED FIBER INSTRUMENTS COULD BE A POWERFUL NEW LIGHTWEIGHT TOOL FOR AN OCEAN WORLD LANDER. TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROJECT ARE: 1. DEVELOP AND BUILD A DIRECT-LASER PENETRATOR 2. TEST AND CHARACTERIZE THE PENETRATOR IN ICE UNDER VACUUM AND AT 100K TEMPERATURE  OVER A RANGE OF PENETRATOR DIAMETERS. 3. INVESTIGATE FIBER-COUPLED OPTICAL SENSING STRATEGIES  INCLUDING BOTH PAIRING THE FIBER WITH POTENTIAL ON-BOARD INSTRUMENTS AS WELL AN IN-SITU DEMONSTRATION OF INTEGRATED SPECTROGRAPHIC AND EM INSTRUMENTS. CO-I HOGAN WILL LEAD DIRECT LASER MELTING DEVELOPMENT AND CRYOBOT DESIGN. CO-I BRAMALL  A LIFE-DETECTION INSTRUMENT DESIGNER  WILL MANAGE FIBER SENSING AND SPECTROSCOPY INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT AND INTEGRATION. CO-I CHRISTNER WILL SERVE AS MICROBIOLOGY ADVISOR.","","2018","$242,255","$0","$242,255","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Texas", "","","","",""
"AEOLIS RESEARCH  INC.","","United States","","","","","MOIST CONVECTION IS LIKELY A CRITICAL PROCESS FOR DETERMINING ENERGY REDISTRIBUTION AND THE DRIVE FOR THE LARGE SCALE CIRCULATION ON GAS GIANT PLANETS. THE UNDERSTANDING OF THESE PROCESSES AND CONSEQUENTLY THEIR REPRESENTATION IN DYNAMICAL MODELS IS AS YET POORLYDEVELOPED. PART OF THIS LACK OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE LACK OF MODELING FRAMEWORKS AND COMPUTING POWER TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE PROBLEM  BUT THE LACK OF GOOD OBSERVATIONAL 'CALIBRATION' CASES HAS ALSO PRESENTED AN OBSTACLE. IN THIS PROPOSAL  WE PROPOSE TO USE ADVANCES IN COMPUTING POWER AND MODEL DEVELOPMENT TO EMPLOY NESTED SYNOPTIC-TO-MESOSCALE MODELING OF CLOUDSYSTEMS AND MOIST CONVECTION USING MASSIVELY PARALLEL COMPUTING. CRUCIALLY  WE PROPOSE TO FOCUS THE EFFORT ON WELL DOCUMENTED ""GREAT WHITE SPOT"" (GWS) CONVECTIVE CLOUD SYSTEMS ON SATURN. NOT ONLY IS THE MORPHOLOGICAL EVOLUTION OF THESE STORMS WELL OBSERVED USING IMAGING  BUT THERMAL AND TRACE PROCESS DATA EXIST FROM THERMAL OBSERVATIONS. IN PARTICULAR  PARA/ORTHO HYDROGEN OBSERVATIONS PROVIDESIGNIFICANT CONSTRAINTS ON THE DISTRIBUTION AND VIGOR OF MOIST CONVECTION.THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO UNDERSTAND THE PHYSICAL PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH CONVECTIVE STORMS AND THE DYNAMICAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN STORMS AND THE LARGE-SCALE DYNAMICS. MORE SPECIFICALLY  WE WILL DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE MOIST CONVECTION SCHEME THAT CHARACTERIZES THE WATER AND AMMONIA CLOUD DYNAMICS ON SATURN AND JUPITER AND INVESTIGATE THE FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF CONVECTIVESTORMS AT VARIOUS SCALES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH A NUMERICAL SCHEME WITHIN GLOBAL MODELS IS A CRITICAL PREREQUISITE FOR MAKING FURTHER PROGRESS ON UNDERSTANDING THE GENERAL CIRCULATION OF THE GAS GIANT ATMOSPHERES.WE PROPOSE TO USE IMAGING AND INFRARED OBSERVATIONS FROM CASSINI IN COMBINATION WITH OUR PLANETWRF MODEL TO EXAMINE MOIST CONVECTION  AND SPECIFICALLY THE WELL DOCUMENTED GWS TEST CASE  ON CLOUD RESOLVING SCALES AND ALSO THEIR INTERACTION WITH LARGER-SCALE FLOWS. THE NESTED CLOUD-RESOLVING TO GLOBAL SCALE CAPABILITY OF PLANETWRF MAKES IT A UNIQUELY CAPABLE MODEL IN THIS APPLICATION. THERESULTS FROM THE USE OF PLANETWRF TO SYNTHESIZE AND GENERALIZED OBSERVATIONS OF MOIST CONVECTION WILL BE USED TO FORMULATE SIMPLIFIED PLUME MODELS OF MOIST CONVECTION THAT CAN BE INCLUDED IN PURELY GLOBAL MODELS OF INSUFFICIENT RESOLUTION TO DIRECTLY CAPTURE THESEPROCESSES.THE GENERAL CIRCULATION OF GAS GIANT ATMOSPHERES IS A MAJOR SCIENCE FOCUS FOR NASA  BOTH IN TERMS OF THE GAS GIANTS IN OUR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM  BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF GAS GIANT DYNAMICS FOR UNDERSTANDING EXTRA-SOLAR PLANETS.","","2018","$242,697","$0","$242,697","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","California", "","","","",""

"PREDICTIVE SCIENCE INCORPORATED","","United States","","","","","THE FORMATION MECHANISMS OF PROMINENCES IN THE SOLAR CORONA ARE AT PRESENT NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS ADDRESSING THESE MECHANISMS HAVE BEEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY RESTRICTED TO ONE-DIMENSIONAL (1D) THERMODYNAMIC CALCULATIONS ALONG STATIC MAGNETIC FIELD LINES. 3D SIMULATIONS ARE CLEARLY REQUIRED TO SUBSTANTIATE AND EXTEND THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY THESE INVESTIGATIONS. WE THEREFORE PROPOSE TO MODEL THE FORMATION AND INTERNAL DYNAMICS OF PROMINENCES  USING NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS THAT CONSIDER A FULLY 3D TREATMENT OF THE THERMODYNAMICS AND TIME-DEPENDENT MAGNETIC FIELDS. WE WILL FOCUS ON THE THERMAL NON-EQUILIBRIUM MECHANISM FOR PROMINENCE FORMATION  BUT WE WILL CONSIDER ALSO MAGNETIC FORCES SUCH AS PLASMA LEVITATION AND INJECTION. OUR SIMULATIONS WILL ALLOW US TO THOROUGHLY TEST THESE MECHANISMS AND TO STUDY THE RESULTING DYNAMICS IN A MORE REALISTIC MAGNETIC FIELD AND PLASMA ENVIRONMENT THAN DONE SO FAR. THEY WILL ALSO PROVIDE PRE-ERUPTIVE CONFIGURATIONS FOR CME SIMULATIONS THAT CONTAIN SELF-CONSISTENTLY PRODUCED PROMINENCE PLASMA DISTRIBUTIONS. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES WE WILL EMPLOY OUR THERMODYNAMIC MHD CODE MAS (MAGNETO-HYDRODYNAMICS AROUND A SPHERE)  DEVELOPED AND MAINTAINED AT PREDICTIVE SCIENCE INC.  TOGETHER WITH OUR RECENTLY DEVELOPED EXTENSION OF THE CORONAL FLUX ROPE MODEL BY TITOV AND DEMOULIN. WE WILL CONSIDER BOTH FLUX ROPE AND ARCADE-LIKE MAGNETIC CONFIGURATIONS AND COMPLEMENT OUR SIMULATIONS BY 1D THERMODYNAMIC CALCULATIONS ALONG INDIVIDUAL FIELD LINES OF THESE CONFIGURATIONS. WE WILL PRODUCE SYNTHETIC EMISSION IMAGES FROM OUR SIMULATIONS AND COMPARE THEM TO PROMINENCE OBSERVATIONS BY SDO/AIA AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS. SPECIFIC CARE WILL BE TAKEN TO INCORPORATE H-ALPHA PROXIES FROM THE LITERATURE AS WELL AS CONTINUUM ABSORPTION OF EUV EMISSION BY PROMINENCE MATERIAL  WHICH IS RELEVANT TO SOME OF THE LATEST OBSERVATIONAL DIAGNOSTICS OF PROMINENCES. OUR SIMULATIONS WILL ALLOW US TO ADDRESS A NUMBER OF OPEN QUESTIONS OF PROMINENCE RESEARCH  SUCH AS: (1) UNDER WHICH CONDITIONS DO LONG-LASTING PLASMA CONDENSATIONS FORM BY CATASTROPHIC COOLING DUE TO THE THERMAL NON-EQUILIBRIUM IN TIME-DEPENDENT 3D MAGNETIC FIELDS? ARE THESE CONDITIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE FOUND IN 1D SIMULATIONS? (2) ARE FIELD-LINE DIPS REQUIRED IN 3D MAGNETIC FIELDS TO FORM LONG-LASTING CONDENSATIONS? (3) CAN THERMAL NON-EQUILIBRIUM EXPLAIN THE FORMATION OF ACTIVE-REGION PROMINENCES  WHICH APPEAR TO BE TOO SHORT FOR CATASTROPHIC COOLING TO OCCUR? (4) CAN FORMATION MECHANISMS BASED ON MAGNETIC FORCES SUCH AS PLASMA LEVITATION AND INJECTION ACCOUNT FOR THE HEIGHT AND MASS OF OBSERVED PROMINENCES? (5) WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE  PROMINENCE-CORONA TRANSITIONREGION ? IN PARTICULAR  WHAT IS THE MAGNETIC FIELD STRUCTURE AND WHAT ARE THE VALUES OF PLASMA DENSITY  TEMPERATURE  AND VELOCITY IN THIS REGION? (6) UNDER WHICH CONDITIONS DO CORONAL CAVITIES FORM? WHAT ARE THEIR PLASMA PROPERTIES AND WHAT IS THEIR UNDERLYING MAGNETIC STRUCTURE? (7) CAN BARBS FORM WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF PARASITIC PHOTOSPHERIC POLARITIES? IF YES  WHAT IS THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM? 8) WHAT DRIVES THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INTERNAL FLOWS IN PROMINENCES?

WE PROPOSE TO DETERMINE THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SUBSURFACE MERIDIONAL CIRCULATION THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF TWO LOCAL-HELIOSEISMIC PROCEDURES TO DOPPLERGRAMS FROM THE HELIOSEISMIC MAGNETIC IMAGER (HMI) ONBOARD THE SOLAR DYNAMICS OBSERVATORY (SDO)  AS WELL AS ARCHIVED DATA FROM THE MICHELSON DOPPLER IMAGER (MDI) ONBOARD THE SOLAR AND HELIOSPHERIC OBSERVATORY (SOHO). THE TWO MAIN METHODS WE WILL EMPLOY ARE LEGENDRE FUNCTION DECOMPOSITION AND HELIOSEISMIC HOLOGRAPHY. INVERSE AND FORWARD MODELING WILL BE CARRIED OUT TO INFER DEPTH  LATITUDE  AND TEMPORAL PROPERTIES OF THE MERIDIONAL FLOW OVER A SPAN OF ALMOST TWO SOLAR CYCLES. THE TWO MAIN CHALLENGES TO A RELIABLE DETERMINATION OF THE MERIDIONAL FLOW - NAMELY A POOR SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO AND THE PRESENCE OF SYSTEMATIC ARTIFACTS - WILL BE ADDRESSED BY 1) USING SUFFICIENTLY LONG DATASETS  2) IMPLEMENTING CONTROL MEASUREMENTS  3) PERFORMING COMPARISONS BETWEEN MULTIPLE METHODS AND INSTRUMENTS  AND 4) CARRYING OUT VALIDATION TESTS WITH ARTIFICIAL DATA. OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IS THE IDENTIFICATION AND REMOVAL OF SYSTEMATIC ARTIFACTS WHICH CAN MIMIC LARGE-SCALE FLOWS AND DETRIMENTALLY IMPACT THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LOW-AMPLITUDE MERIDIONAL CIRCULATION. THIS INVESTIGATION IS TIMELY IN THAT THE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES INTO THE SOHO AND SDO MISSIONS IS NOW YIELDING THE DECADES-LONG DATASET REQUIRED FOR THE RELIABLE DETERMINATION OF THE PROPERTIES OF THESE FLOWS.

WE PROPOSE A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY THAT LEVERAGES THIS DATA TO CHARACTERIZE THE EVOLUTION OF CORONAL HOLES CHS AND IN TURN UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS OF THE CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE CHANGES. OUR RESEARCH WILL ADDRESS THREE PRIMARY SCIENCE TOPICS: 1 - HOW DO CHS EVOLVE ON TIMESCALES FROM SEVERAL WEEKS TO YEARS? 2 - WHAT FRACTION OF THE INTERPLANETARY MAGNETIC FIELD EMANATES FROM CHS? 3 - HOW MUCH OF THE SOLAR WIND ARISES FROM DYNAMIC MAGNETICFLUX CHANGE AT CH BOUNDARIES?WE WILL EMPLOY A RECENTLY DEVELOPED CH DETECTION PIPELINE DESIGNED WITH THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF ROBUSTLY TRACKING CHS FOR WEEKS AT A TIME. THE TIMESCALE OF SEVERAL WEEKS IS CRUCIAL FOR CONNECTING THE DYNAMICAL EVOLUTION OF CHS TO THE LARGE SCALE STRUCTURE OF THE CORONA AND THE SOLAR WIND. OUR NOVEL TECHNIQUE ALLOWS US TO CONSISTENTLY MEASURE CH POSITIONS AND PROPERTIES AS THEY EVOLVE AND TRANSITIONFROM THE VIEW OF ONE SPACECRAFT TO ANOTHER. WE WILL PRODUCE FULL SUN MAPS OF CH POSITIONS OVER A SUBSTANTIAL DATASET  AND USE THIS TO CHARACTERIZE THE WAY IN WHICH CH BOUNDARIES EVOLVE AND DISTORT WITH TIME. THIS ANALYSIS WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED BY OVERLAYING CH MEASUREMENTS WITH PHOTOSPHERIC FLUXES DERIVED FROM AN OBSERVATION BASED  FREELY AVAILABLE SURFACE FLUX TRANSPORT MODEL. SPECIFICALLY THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON TWO CLOSELY-RELATED THEMES:1 - A LONG TERM STUDY OF CH EVOLUTION SPANNING THE LIFETIME OF THE STEREO MISSION. WE WILL PROCESS 195A AND 193A EUV IMAGING DATA FROM THE ENTIRE STEREO EUVI 2007 TO PRESENT AND SDO AIA 2010 TO PRESENT ARCHIVES AT A 2HR CADENCE USING OUR NEW DETECTION PIPELINE. THIS WILL PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE ARCHIVE OF CHS DURING THIS TIME PERIOD THAT WILL BE USED TO DERIVE LONG TERM TRENDS THAT TELL US HOW CHS EVOLVE AND HOW THEY RELATE TO THE INTERPLANETARY FLUX DERIVED FROM IN SITU MEASUREMENTS ACE WIND.2 - DETAILED CASE STUDIES OF CH EVOLUTION AT HIGH CADENCE FOR TWO DISTINCT PERIODS.

THE FIRST CASE STUDY WILL ALLOW US TO CHARACTERIZE HOW CHS EVOLVE DURING THE ABSENCE OF LARGE SCALE FLUX EMERGENCE  WHILE THE LATTER WILL ALLOW US EXAMINE THE ROLE OF FLUX EMERGENCE SPECIFICALLY. THESE STUDIES WILL ALLOW US TO CHARACTERIZE IN DETAIL HOW CHS EVOLVE. OUR CASE STUDY RESULTS WILL ALSO BE USED TO REFINE OUR ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF THE LONGTERM STUDY.THIS PROJECT IS HIGHLY RELEVANT TO THE HELIOPHYSICS GUEST INVESTIGATORS PROGRAM. OUR OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES WILL LEVERAGE FREELY AVAILABLE MEASUREMENTS AND COMBINE INFORMATION FROM FOUR SEPARATE SPACECRAFT IN HELIOPHYSICS SYSTEM OBSERVATORY.

"G & A TECHNICAL SOFTWARE INC","","United States","","","","","RECENT STUDIES INDICATE THAT THE OCCURRENCE AND BRIGHTNESS OF POLAR MESOSPHERIC CLOUDS (PMCS) DIMINISH FOLLOWING ENHANCED PLANETARY ROSSBY WAVE (PRW) ACTIVITY AND WARM WINTER STRATOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES. THEORETICAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE CAUSE OF THIS APPARENT TELECONNECTION HAVE TARGETED THE RESPONSE OF THE GRAVITY WAVE (GW)-DRIVEN MESOSPHERIC CIRCULATION TO ENHANCED PRW FORCING IN THE WINTER STRATOSPHERE. HOWEVER  IT IS KNOWN THAT THE MESOSPHERIC 2-DAY WAVE WAS ALSO ENHANCED DURING SEASONS OF INCREASED PRW ACTIVITY AND REDUCED PMC BRIGHTNESS. MOMENTUM DEPOSITION BY DISSIPATING 2-DAY WAVES DRIVES A CIRCULATION THAT CAN WARM THE POLAR SUMMER MESOPAUSE BY AS MUCH AS 5K. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ARCTIC WINTER PRW ACTIVITY AND SUMMER MESOSPHERIC 2-DAY WAVE ENHANCEMENTS HAS NOT BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATED IN OBSERVATIONS. DRAWING ON WORK BY ORSOLINI ET AL.

THE LEADING OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE TO HARNESS SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS TO EXPLICITLY QUANTIFY THE EFFECTS OF THE 2-DAY WAVE UPON PMC  AND THE COUPLING OF THE 2-DAY WAVE TO PRW BREAKING AND INERTIAL INSTABILITY. WE WILL 1. COMPUTE 2-DAY WAVE FORCING FROM TEMPERATURES MAPPED DURING THE AIM MISSION AUSTRAL SUMMERS  AND EXAMINE THE RESPONSE OF THE SUMMER MESOPAUSE TO THIS FORCING USING A 2D MODEL; 2. EVALUATE THE SENSITIVITY OF ICE FORMATION AND OCCURRENCE IN A 0-D MODEL TO 2-DAY WAVE FORCING  AND COMPARE WITH AIM DATA; 3. ANALYZE CONCURRENT WINTERTIME PLANETARY WAVES AND INERTIAL INSTABILITY IN TIMED AND AURA TEMPERATURES  AND ESTIMATE THEIR WAVE FORCING  AND 4. USE A PRIMITIVE EQUATION MODEL TO EXPLICITLY EVALUATE THE RESPONSE OF THE SUMMER EASTERLY JET TO FORCING BY PLANETARY WAVES AND INERTIAL INSTABILITY. THE PROPOSED WORK DESCRIBES AN END-TO-END STUDY QUANTIFYING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF PLANETARY WAVE-DRIVEN CIRCULATIONS TO THE ARCTIC-SUMMER MESOPAUSE TELECONNECTION.

SPECIFIC RESEARCH GOALS ARE ANTICIPATED TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:1) EXPLORATION OF GW INITIATION OF MSTIDS AT MID-LATITUDES  AND THE DEPENDENCE OF GENERATION EFFICIENCY ON GW SCALES  ORIENTATIONS  AND AMPLITUDES 2) CONTRIBUTIONS BY UPWARD-PROPAGATING OR DUCTED GWS TO MID-LATITUDE SPREAD F  AND3) RESPONSES TO SPECIFIC GW SOURCES  ESPECIALLY DEEP CONVECTION AND AURORAL HEATING. PROPOSED METHODS:OUR APPROACH WILL EMPLOY TWO STATE-OF-THE-ART MODELS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN APPLIED TO A RANGE OF NEUTRAL AND PLASMA PROBLEMS. THESE INCLUDE:1) A FINITE-VOLUME 3D CODE DESCRIBING GW GENERATION  PROPAGATION  INTERACTIONS AND INSTABILITIES FROM THE GW SOURCES TO ~300-400 KM IN EITHER A COMPRESSIBLE OR AN ANELASTIC FRAMEWORK  AND 2) A 3D ELECTRODYNAMICS CODE THAT DESCRIBES PLASMA INSTABILITIES AND TURBULENCE AND CAN EMPLOY NEUTRAL FORCING IN VARIOUS FIELD AND PLASMA CONFIGURATIONS.  IN OUR APPLICATIONS  THE NEUTRAL FV CODE WILL PROVIDE THE INITIAL AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR THE ED CODE  WHICH WILL THEN ALLOW US TO EXAMINE THE PLASMA RESPONSES AND THE COUPLING PHYSICS. PERCEIVED SIGNIFICANCE:OUR PROPOSED RESEARCH WOULD ADDRESS NEUTRAL ATMOSPHERE - IONOSPHERE COUPLING AT SMALL SPATIAL SCALES THAT ARE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO QUANTIFY WITH CURRENT OBSERVATIONAL METHODS.

"PHOTON SYSTEMS  INC.","DowDuPont","United States","","","","","THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE NEED FOR AN ULTRA-COMPACT DEEP UV (DUV) SOURCE EMITTING IN THE 230 NM TO 240 NM SPECTRAL RANGE TO ENABLE NEW ULTRA-COMPACT TRACE ORGANIC CHEMICAL&WATER ICE IMAGING AND POINT DETECTION RAMAN&FLUORESCENCE INSTRUMENTS FOR LANDER MISSIONS TO  OCEAN WORLDS  OF THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM AND SMALL TO MEDIUM CLASS DISCOVERY/NEW FRONTIERS LANDER MISSIONS TO PRIMITIVE BODIES  DWARF PLANETS AND ASTEROIDS. DETECTION OF ORGANICS  PREBIOTIC  AND BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL AND WATER ICE AND THEIR SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION ARE FUNDAMENTAL CAPABILITIES REQUIRED TO MEET NASA STRATEGIC GOALS. THE NEW SOURCE IS CALLED A LIGHT EMITTING TRIODE (LET) WHICH GENERATES INTENSE DUV LIGHT AT WAVELENGTHS THAT SEPARATE THE SPECTRAL REGIONS IN WHICH RAMAN AND FLUORESCENCE EMISSIONS OCCUR. THE RESULT IS NO SPECTRAL OVERLAP OR OBSCURATION OF RAMAN BANDS BY FLUORESCENCE AND NO ALTERATION OF FLUORESCENCE EMISSION SPECTRA BY STRONG RAMAN BANDS  THUS ENABLING TWO INDEPENDENT AND ORTHOGONAL SETS OF SPECTRAL INFORMATION TO ENHANCE IDENTIFICATION OF TRACE MATERIAL ON TARGETED SURFACES. DEEP UV NATIVE FLUORESCENCE IS THE ONLY KNOWN MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE THAT CAN PROVIDE SUB-PARTS-PER-BILLION SENSITIVITY FOR ORGANIC COMPOUNDS WITHOUT ANY SAMPLE ACQUISITION  PROCESSING  OR USE OF REAGENTS. FLUORESCENCE PROVIDES VALUABLE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE OVERALL ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATION OF COMPOUNDS  ENABLING DETECTION AND DIFFERENTIATION OF AROMATIC RING STRUCTURES OF VARYING RING NUMBERS AND CONFORMATIONAL ARRANGEMENTS. IN ADDITION  ORGANIC COMPOUNDS ON LOW TEMPERATURE ICY PLANETARY BODIES EXHIBIT MOLECULAR VIBRATIONAL FEATURES  SIMILAR TO RAMAN SCATTERING OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS BUT WITH THE SENSITIVITY OF FLUORESCENCE  THAT PROVIDE STRUCTURAL DETAILS SUCH AS THE ARRANGEMENT OF METHYL GROUPS AND THE PRESENCE AND VARIABILITY OF FUNCTIONAL GROUPS (P. JOHNSON  2011). DEEP UV FLUORESCENCE HAS ALSO BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO UNIQUELY DIFFERENTIATE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS FROM COMPOSITE MATERIALS SUCH AS MICROBIAL SPORES OR CELLS (BHARTIA  ET.AL. 2008). THE KEY ENABLING REQUIREMENT OF ALL OF THESE INSTRUMENTAL CAPABILITIES  WHETHER POINT DETECTION  MAPPING  OR IMAGING  IS THE AVAILABILITY OF A DEEP UV LIGHT SOURCE EMITTING IN THE 230 NM TO 240 NM SPECTRAL RANGE WITH HIGH SOURCE RADIANCE AND RELATIVELY NARROW EMISSION BANDWIDTH. THE FOCUS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THEREFORE TO DEVELOP A DUV-LET EMITTING IN THE 230 NM TO 240 NM SPECTRAL RANGE WHICH HAS A SIZE ABOUT 1 CC  A WEIGHT ABOUT 5 G  AND POWER CONSUMPTION LESS THAN ABOUT 100 MW. THIS DUV SOURCE IS OVER 250 TIMES SMALLER AND LIGHTER THAN THE DUV LASER WHICH CURRENTLY POWERS THE MARS 2020 SHERLOC DEEP UV RAMAN AND FLUORESCENCE INSTRUMENT AND CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON FUTURE OVERALL INSTRUMENT SIZES AND WEIGHTS. THE DUV-LET SOURCE EMPLOYS A SUBMINIATURE ELECTRON BEAM PUMPED ALGAN SEMICONDUCTOR WITH ABOUT 75% AL IN THE MULTIPLE QUANTUM WELLS TO PROVIDE EMISSION AT 235 NM. THE TERM LIGHT EMITTING TRIODE (LET) DERIVES BECAUSE IT HAS A GRID BETWEEN THE CATHODE AND ANODE OF THE SOURCE AND TO DIFFERENTIATE IT FROM TRADITIONAL PN-JUNCTION LIGHT EMITTING DIODES (LEDS). ELECTRON BEAM PUMPING AVOIDS THE ESSENTIALLY INSURMOUNTABLE PROBLEMS WITH THE PN JUNCTION TECHNOLOGY OF LEDS SUCH AS REALIZATION OF BOTH A HIGH HOLE CONCENTRATION AND LOW-RESISTIVITY P-TYPE ALGAN WITH HIGH ENOUGH ALN MOLE FRACTION TO SEPARATE RAMAN AND FLUORESCENCE SPECTRAL REGIONS. ANOTHER FEATURE OF THE LET IS THAT IT IS INSENSITIVE TO HIGH ENERGY IONIZING RADIATION EXPECTED IN THE REGIONS OF MANY CELESTIAL BODIES OF INTEREST. THE CORE TECHNOLOGY THAT ENABLES THE PROPOSED DUV-LET IS A PATENTED (USP 7 590 161  2009) SUB-250 NM  NARROW LINEWIDTH  DEEP UV SOURCE WHICH WAS INITIALLY DEVELOPED WITH FUNDING FROM NASA/ASTID AND DOD/DARPA CONTRACTS WHICH BROUGHT THE BASIC TRL LEVEL UP ABOUT 2. THIS PROPOSED EFFORT WILL FURTHER IMPROVE UPON THESE PRIOR NASA AND DOD FUNDED EFFORTS TO DEMONSTRATE A FUNCTIONAL 1 CC DUV-LET AT TRL LEVEL BETWEEN 3 AND 4.","","2018","$297,521","$0","$297,521","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","California", "Delaware","USA","publicly traded","chemicals","chemicals"

"ALPERIN NONINVASIVE DIAGNOSTICS  INC","","United States","","","","","ELEVATED INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE (ICP) DUE TO MICROGRAVITY-INDUCED CEPHALAD FLUID REDISTRIBUTION IS CURRENTLY THOUGHT TO BE THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE VISUAL IMPAIRMENT/INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE (VIIP) SYNDROME. CURRENTLY  THE ONLY AVAILABLE MEASUREMENT OF ICP IS A POSTFLIGHT OPENING PRESSURE VIA LUMBAR PUNCTURE (LP). GIVEN THE INVASIVENESS OF LP AND THE RELUCTANCE TO UTILIZE IT IN THE ABSENCE OF CLINICAL INDICATIONS  ICP ELEVATIONS ARE YET TO BE CONSISTENTLY DOCUMENTED IN CREWMEMBERS. IN ADDITION  THE CAUSE FOR ICP ELEVATION IN-FLIGHT HAS NOT YET BEEN ESTABLISHED. CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS OF THE VIIP SYNDROME MAINLY FOCUS ON THE VASCULAR AND INTERSTITIAL COMPONENTS OF THE CEPHALAD FLUID REDISTRIBUTION. AN OVERLOOKED COMPONENT OF FLUID SHIFT THAT THIS STUDY WILL EVALUATED IS THE REDISTRIBUTION OF CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) IN THE CRANIOSPINAL SYSTEM AND ITS EFFECT ON ICP. AS THE CRANIUM CONTAINS MORE CSF THAN BLOOD  THIS COMPONENT OF FLUID SHIFT MAY BE A LARGER CONTRIBUTOR TO ICP ELEVATIONS THAN THE VASCULAR/INTERSTITIAL COMPONENTS. THE POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN SPINAL CANAL COMPLIANCE BUFFERING DUE TO SPINAL ELONGATION MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO ICP ELEVATIONS AS WELL.THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL UTILIZE SPECIALIZED MRI SEQUENCES  COLLECTED ON 7 SHORT-DURATION AND 10 LONG-DURATION CREWMEMBERS  TO ASSESS CSF HYDRODYNAMICS AND VASCULAR HEMODYNAMICS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO VIIP. KEY PARAMETERS THAT WILL BE ANALYZED INCLUDE TOTAL CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW  VENOUS DRAINAGE  INTRACRANIAL COMPLIANCE AND PRESSURE AS WELL AS CRANIO-SPINAL COMPLIANCE DISTRIBUTION. THESE VALUES WILL BE CORRELATED WITH CHANGES IN VISUAL/OCULAR FUNCTION AND MORPHOLOGY  AND MEASURES OF SPINAL ELONGATION. EFFECTS OF MISSION DURATION WILL BE ELUCIDATED BY COMPARING SHORT AND LONG-DURATION CREWMEMBERS. THESE ANALYSES WILL ELUCIDATE THE ROLE OF CEPHALAD CSF SHIFT IN THE ETIOLOGY OF VIIP  WILL DEFINE HYDRODYNAMIC MEASURES THAT MAY PREDICT SUSCEPTIBILITY TO VIIP  AND MAY LEAD TO IDENTIFICATION OF NOVEL COUNTERMEASURES. THIS STUDY WILL BE CONSTRAINED BY THE NUMBER OF SUBJECT MRIS AVAILABLE FOR ANALYSIS  COMPARED WITH AN OPTIMAL TERRESTRIAL STUDY WHERE MORE SUBJECTS WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR STUDY.","","2018","$300,000","$0","$300,000","NASA Exploration Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.003","","Florida", "","","","",""

"SYSTEM SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INC","","United States","","","","","THE GOAL OF THE TUNASCAPE PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A THREE-DIMENSIONAL ECOSYSTEM MODEL OF THE TUNA FISHERY OF THE EASTERN TROPICAL PACIFIC OCEAN (ETPO) THAT WILL DESCRIBE HOW OCEAN CIRCULATION FROM SUBMESOSCALE TO GLOBAL SCALES DRIVES THE SPATIAL-TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF COMMERCIAL TUNA SPECIES (SKIPJACK  YELLOWFIN  AND BIGEYE). TO MEET THIS GOAL TUNASCAPE WILL ADDRESS A BROAD RANGE OF QUESTIONS: WHY DOES THE SHALLOW HYPOXIC LAYER THAT COVERS THOUSANDS OF SQUARE KILOMETERS OF THE ETPO APPEAR TO SHAPE THE DISTRIBUTION OF BOTH PRIMARY PRODUCTION AND THE CATCH OF THE COMMERCIAL SPECIES? IS THE SHALLOW HYPOXIC LAYER SIMPLY THE RESULT OF EQUATORIAL AND COASTAL UPWELLING OR IS IT ALSO STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY VERTICAL COMPRESSION OF THE PLANKTONIC AND PELAGIC COMMUNITIES? WHAT SCALE OF SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION IS REQUIRED TO RESOLVE VORTICITY STRUCTURES THAT LEAD TO THE AGGREGATION OF THE TUNA AND PRESUMABLY THEIR PREY? WILL THIS SCALE BE ACHIEVED WITH THE NEW OCEAN COLOR  THERMAL  AND ALTIMETRY SENSORS SOON TO BE LAUNCHED? THE TUNASCAPE MODEL WILL BE DRIVEN BY NASA S SATELLITE IMAGERY OF SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE  COLOR  HEIGHT  AND WIND SPEED AS WELL AS OUTPUT FROM ITS ECCO 18 KM AND 2.3 KM GLOBAL CIRCULATION MODELS. THE MODEL WILL CONSIST OF THREE COMPONENTS: THE ECCO GLOBAL CIRCULATION MODEL; A PLANKTON MODEL THAT WILL BE A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE 18 KM DARWIN MODEL AND OF THE 2.3 KM BLING MODEL; AND AN AGENT-BASED  POPULATION DYNAMICS MODEL OF THE THREE TUNA SPECIES. THE TUNA MODEL  WHICH WAS RECENTLY COMPLETED AS PART NSF S FISHSCAPE PROJECT  IS BASED UPON THE INTER-AMERICAN TROPICAL TUNA COMMISSION (IATTC) S 50-YEAR RECORD ON CATCH AND EFFORT. THE IATTC PURSE SEINE DATA PROVIDED TO US WAS MONTHLY SPECIES CATCH AT A SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF 1 DEGREE. FOR THE TUNASCAPE PROJECT WE HAVE BEEN OFFERED ACCESS TO DATA AT SUBMESOSCALE RESOLUTION (<10 KM). THE COUPLING OF HIGH RESOLUTION MODELS OF OCEANOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS WITH HIGH RESOLUTION FISHERY DATA WILL OFFER NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE LINKAGE BETWEEN CIRCULATION AND THE HABITAT OF SPECIES THAT OCCUPY THE HIGHEST TROPHIC LEVEL OF THE ECOSYSTEM. DARWIN AND BLING BOTH RUN WITHIN THE 18 KM ECCO CIRCULATION MODEL AND BOTH MODELS TRACK THE TRANSFORMATIONS OF OXYGEN  CARBON DIOXIDE  NUTRIENTS  AND PLANKTON COMPONENTS. THE MODELS WILL BE MODIFIED TO INCLUDE A FORMULATION FOR VERTICALLY MIGRATING ZOOPLANKTON AND NEKTON (PREY TARGETED BY TUNA) SINCE THIS COMPONENT PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE FORMATION OF THE HYPOXIC LAYER. THE TUNA MODEL DESCRIBES THE MOVEMENT  GROWTH  METABOLISM  FISHING AND NATURAL MORTALITIES  AND RECRUITMENT OF AGE-CLASSES OF METAPOPULATIONS OF THE THREE TUNA SPECIES. MOVEMENT INCLUDES HORIZONTAL MOVEMENT BY DRIFT AND TAXIS AND RANDOM SWIMMING  SCHOOL FORMATION  AND VERTICAL POSITIONING BY THE FISH.

"NORTHWEST RESEARCH ASSOCIATES  INC.","","United States","","","","","THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO DETERMINE THE INTERNAL AND SUBSURFACE STRUCTURE OF SOLAR MAGNETIC FLUX CONCENTRATIONS  SUCH AS SUNSPOTS AND PLAGE. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF LOCAL HELIOSEISMIC DATA ANALYSIS AND THEORETICAL MODELING OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN SOLAR OSCILLATIONS AND MAGNETIC FLUX CONCENTRATIONS. WE WILL DEVELOP MODELS FOR THE INTERNAL AND SUBSURFACE STRUCTURE OF SOLAR MAGNETIC FLUX CONCENTRATIONS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH BOTH LOCAL HELIOSEISMIC MEASUREMENTS AND MEASUREMENTS OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD AT THE SOLAR PHOTOSPHERE. TO MAKE THESE MEASUREMENTS WE WILL USE THE HELIOSEISMIC AND MAGNETIC IMAGER (HMI) ON THE SOLAR DYNAMICS OBSERVATORY (SDO). TO DETERMINE THE INTERNAL AND SUBSURFACE STRUCTURE OF SOLAR MAGNETIC FLUX CONCENTRATIONS WE WILL TAKE THE FOLLOWING APPROACH: (1) CONSTRUCT A SET OF MAGNETOHYDROSTATIC MODELS FOR A GIVEN MAGNETIC FLUX CONCENTRATION USING THE MAGNETIC FIELD OBSERVED AT THE PHOTOSPHERE AS A CONSTRAINT. (2) USE NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF WAVE INTERACTIONS WITH THE MAGNETOHYDROSTATIC MODELS TO GENERATE SYNTHETIC HELIOSEISMIC DATA. (3) APPLY HELIOSEISMIC MEASUREMENT PROCEDURES TO BOTH THE OBSERVATIONAL DATA AND THE SYNTHETIC DATA. (4) SELECT THE MODELS THAT PROVIDE THE BEST AGREEMENT WITH OBSERVATIONS. THIS APPROACH WILL BE VALIDATED USING ARTIFICIAL DATA FROM REALISTIC MAGNETOCONVECTION SIMULATIONS WHERE THE SUBSURFACE STRUCTURE OF THE MAGNETIC FLUX CONCENTRATION IS KNOWN.","","2018","$316,253","$0","$316,253","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Washington", "","","","",""

"NORTHWEST RESEARCH ASSOCIATES  INC.","","United States","","","","","THE ENERGY TO POWER SOLAR ENERGETIC EVENTS MUST ULTIMATELY ORIGINATE AT OR BELOW THE SOLAR PHOTOSPHERE  AND IS LIKELY TO BUILD UP IN THE CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD BEFORE RELEASE IN AN EVENT. IN ORDER TO FULLY UNDERSTAND FLARES AND CMES  IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY STORED IN THE CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD. ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES IN ESTIMATING THE CORONAL ENERGY IS THAT THE RESULTS CANNOT EASILY BE TESTED ON DATA FOR WHICH THE ANSWER IS KNOWN. HOWEVER  BY COMPARING THE FLUX INTO AND OUT OF THE CORONA WITH ESTIMATES OF THE ENERGY AT SPECIFIC TIMES OBTAINED FROM A VARIETY OF APPROACHES  WE CAN CONSTRAIN THE RESULTS OF THE METHODS. FOR EXAMPLE  IF THE FLUX INTO THE CORONA SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEEDS THE FLUX OUT OF THE CORONA OVER AN EXTENDED TIME INTERVAL  THEN EITHER THE INPUT FLUX IS BEING OVERESTIMATED  OR THE OUTPUT FLUX IS BEING UNDERESTIMATED. THE PROPOSED WORK ADDRESSES THE FIRST AND FOURTH HIGH LEVEL SCIENCE GOALS FROM THE HELIOPHYSICS DECADAL SURVEY  NAMELY  1. ""DETERMINE THE ORIGINS OF THE SUN'S ACTIVITY AND PREDICT THE VARIATIONS IN THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT"" AND  4. ""DISCOVER AND CHARACTERIZE FUNDAMENTAL PROCESSES THAT OCCUR BOTH WITHIN THE HELIOSPHERE AND THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE."" THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION WILL MODEL HOW THE ENERGY WHICH POWERS SOLAR ENERGETIC EVENTS IS STORED IN THE CORONA  AND MAY LEAD TO NEW TOOLS FOR PREDICTING THE VARIATIONS IN THE X-RAY FLUX IN THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT. INSOFAR AS OTHER STARS ALSO HAVE MAGNETIZED CORONAE  IT MAY CHARACTERIZE A PROCESS OCCURRING THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE. TO TRACK THE FLOW OF FREE ENERGY THROUGH THE PHOTOSPHERE  WE WILL USE DAVE4VM TO ESTIMATE THE PHOTOSPHERIC FLOWS  AND FROM THESE COMPUTE THE POYNTING FLUX INTO THE CORONA. TO ESTIMATE THE ENERGY IN THE CORONA AT A GIVEN TIME  WE WILL USE NONLINEAR FORCE-FREE FIELD (NLFFF) EXTRAPOLATIONS FROM INDIVIDUAL MAGNETOGRAMS. IN ADDITION  WE WILL MODEL THE EVOLUTION OF THE CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD USING A SEQUENCE OF MAGNETOGRAMS AS THE BOUNDARY CONDITION FOR AN MHD SIMULATION AND A TOPOLOGICAL METHOD; THE CORONAL ENERGY FROM THESE INDEPENDENT METHODS CAN BE EVALUATED AT THE SAME TIMES AS THE NLFFF EXTRAPOLATIONS. FINALLY  WE WILL ESTIMATE THE ENERGY LOST FROM THE CORONA. THE RADIATIVE AND CONDUCTIVE LOSSES  FOR EXAMPLE  CAN BE ESTIMATED BASED ON DOING A DIFFERENTIAL EMISSION MEASURE ANALYSIS TO EXTRACT CORONAL TEMPERATURE AND DENSITY ESTIMATES  AND USING THESE TO ESTIMATE RADIATIVE AND CONDUCTIVE LOSSES. FOR THIS INVESTIGATION  WE WILL CONSIDER A SMALL SAMPLE OF ACTIVE REGIONS  ON THE ORDER OF TEN  AND FOCUS ON REGIONS WHICH ARE NOT THE LARGEST AND MOST COMPLICATED  TO MAXIMIZE THE CHANCES OF SUCCESSFULLY MODELING THEM. WE WILL FOLLOW EACH REGION FOR AT LEAST A WEEK  TRACKING THE FLUX OF ENERGY INTO THE CORONA  AND THE ENERGY RELEASED FROM THE CORONA  AS WELL AS ESTIMATING THE ENERGY CONTENT OF THE CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD AT SPECIFIC TIMES. OUR INVESTIGATION WILL PRIMARILY UTILIZE DATA FROM NASA'S SOLAR DYNAMICS OBSERVATORY  BOTH SEQUENCES OF MAGNETOGRAMS FROM THE HELIOSEISMIC AND MAGNETIC IMAGER (HMI) AND CORONAL IMAGES FROM THE ATMOSPHERIC IMAGING ASSEMBLY (AIA). THESE WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED BY MAGNETOGRAMS FROM THE SOLAR OPTICAL TELESCOPE (SOT) ON THE JOINT JAXA/NASA HINODE MISSION  AND BY CORONAL IMAGES FROM HINODE'S X-RAY TELESCOPE (XRT).","","2018","$330,026","$0","$330,026","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Washington", "","","","",""

WHILE THE TRADITIONAL VIEW OF STRATOSPHERIC TRANSPORT PRIMARILY HIGHLIGHTS THE ROLE OF GRAVITY WAVES IN DRIVING THE MESOSPHERIC CIRCULATION  RECENT RESEARCH HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF GRAVITY WAVE DRAG DIRECTLY IN THE STRATOSPHERE  AND ADDITIONAL RESEARCH SUGGESTS IMPORTANT ROLES IN FINE-SCALE STRATOSPHERE-TROPOSPHERE EXCHANGE PROCESSES. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL UTILIZE A VARIETY OF NASA SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS  INCLUDING RECORDS LONGER THAN A DECADE  TO ADDRESS PROCESSES WITHIN LOCAL EVENTS AS WELL AS LONG-TERM GLOBAL VARIABILITY. OUR WORK VERY DIRECTLY ADDRESSES ONE OF THE  OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS FOR THE COMING DECADE  REPORTED FOLLOWING THE 2014 WORKSHOP ON ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION  CHEMISTRY  DYNAMICS AND RADIATION AT NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTER  NAMELY   WHAT ROLE DO GRAVITY WAVES PLAY IN DRIVING THE LARGE-SCALE CIRCULATION?  SPECIFIC TO THE AURA SCIENCE TEAM/ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION MODELING AND ANALYSIS PROGRAM (AST/ACMAP) ANNOUNCEMENT  THE WORK FOCUSES ON MEASUREMENTS FROM THE HIGH RESOLUTION DYNAMICS LIMB SOUNDER (HIRDLS) AND MICROWAVE LIMB SOUNDER (MLS) INSTRUMENTS ON AURA TOGETHER WITH OTHER SATELLITE-BASED PRODUCTS AND PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED IDEALIZED MODEL TOOLS TO CONSTRAIN REGIONAL GRAVITY WAVE DRAG EVENTS  STUDY THEIR DYNAMICAL INTERACTIONS WITH ROSSBY WAVES  AND ASSESS EFFECTS IN CHEMICAL TRACER MEASUREMENTS. GRAVITY WAVE DRAG IS ONE COMPONENT OF THE WAVE-DRIVEN FORCE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GLOBAL STRATOSPHERIC TRANSPORT CIRCULATION  THE BREWER-DOBSON CIRCULATION  NAMED FOR THE PIONEERING WORK OF A.W. BREWER AND G.M.B. DOBSON WHO INFERRED THIS GLOBAL EQUATOR-TOPOLE CIRCULATION FROM MEASUREMENTS OF OZONE AND WATER VAPOR. THE BREWER-DOBSON CIRCULATION HAS A RANGE OF IMPACTS ON ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND CLIMATE. TO FIRST ORDER IT EXPLAINS THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE AGE OF STRATOSPHERIC AIR  WHICH HAS IMPORTANT EFFECTS ON THE LIFETIMES OF OZONE-DEPLETING SUBSTANCES AND SOME GREENHOUSE GASES. IT HAS A DOMINANT INFLUENCE ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE VERY COLD TROPICAL TROPOPAUSE AND CORRESPONDING INFLUENCES ON TROPICAL CIRRUS CLOUDS AND GLOBAL WATER VAPOR WITH ASSOCIATED RADIATIVE EFFECTS AND ROLE IN SURFACE TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY. IN GENERAL  THE BREWER-DOBSON CIRCULATION DESCRIBES THE RECIRCULATION PATHWAYS AND THE PROCESSING TIME OF CHEMICAL TRACERS THROUGH THE STRATOSPHERE AND THEIR EVENTUAL RETURN TO THE TROPOSPHERE  THEREBY ALSO COMPRISING A MAJOR COMPONENT OF STRATOSPHERE-TROPOSPHERE EXCHANGE. THE CURRENT PARADIGM REPRESENTED IN THE WAY SMALL-SCALE GRAVITY WAVE DRAG PROCESSES ARE TREATED IN GLOBAL MODELS SUGGESTS THAT ONLY OROGRAPHIC GRAVITY WAVE DRAG AFFECTS THE STRATOSPHERE  WHILE WAVES FROM OTHER SOURCES  LIKE CONVECTION  PRIMARILY ONLY AFFECT THE MESOSPHERE DIRECTLY. RECENT OBSERVATIONAL EVIDENCE TELLS A VERY DIFFERENT STORY: INFREQUENT  BUT VERY LARGE AMPLITUDE NON-OROGRAPHIC GRAVITY WAVES  CARRY A LARGE FRACTION OF THE CIRCULATION-DRIVING FLUX UPWARD ACROSS THE TROPOPAUSE. HENCE  THESE LARGE EVENTS VERY LIKELY FORCE THE LOWER STRATOSPHERE DIRECTLY WITH LOCALIZED INTERMITTENT DRAG FORCES. SUCH REALISTIC GRAVITY WAVE-DRIVEN FORCES IN THE STRATOSPHERE ARE NOT CURRENTLY REPRESENTED IN GLOBAL MODELS. OUR WORK WILL QUANTIFY THESE EVENTS USING AURA AND OTHER SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS  EXAMINE THEIR INTERACTION WITH LARGER-SCALE SYNOPTIC AND PLANETARY WAVES AND INVESTIGATE THEIR EFFECTS ON CHEMICAL TRACERS IN THE STRATOSPHERE. RECENT RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT REALISTICALLY INTERMITTENT GRAVITY WAVE DRAG WILL GIVE RISE TO SIGNIFICANTLY MORE VARIABILITY IN CHEMISTRY-CLIMATE MODELS THAN IS CURRENTLY REPRESENTED WITHIN THE CURRENT PARADIGM.","","2018","$336,578","$0","$336,578","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Washington", "","","","",""

TIDE FORCING ARISES FROM WATER VAPOR HEATING IN THE TROPOSPHERE  LATENT HEATING IN THE TROPOSPHERE  OZONE HEATING IN THE STRATOSPHERE  AND NONLINEAR INTERACTION BETWEEN STATIONARY PLANETARY WAVES AND THE MIGRATING TIDES. VARIATIONS IN THE FORCING WILL ARISE FROM VARIABILITY IN CLOUD PATTERNS FOR THE FIRST TWO MECHANISMS AND VARIABILITY IN PLANETARY WAVES FOR THE REMAINING TWO. BECAUSE TIDES ARISE FROM SOLAR FORCING IN THE LOWER AND MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE  BUT PROPAGATE WELL INTO THE THERMOSPHERE  THEY REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT DYNAMICAL COUPLING BETWEEN ATMOSPHERIC REGIONS. TIDAL FORCING TO BE USED IN OUR MODEL WILL BE DERIVED FROM NASA SATELLITE MISSIONS TIMED  MLS  TRMM  AND THE NASA DATA ASSIMILATION SYSTEM MERRA.

"NORTHROP GRUMMAN SYSTEMS CORPORATION","Northrop Grumman","United States","","","","","NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION (NGC) WIT THE JET PROPULSION LABORATORY (JPL) PROPOSE DEVELOPMENT IN TWO TECHNICAL AREAS FOR THIS ACT   INTEGRATED RECEIVER AND SWITCH TECHNOLOGY (IRAST): 1) A HIGHLY INTEGRATED HETERODYNE RECEIVER CAPABLE OF SIMULTANEOUSLY OBSERVING THE 424 GHZ OXYGEN BAND AND THE 448 GHZ WATER VAPOR BAND2) SUBMILLIMETER WAVE SWITCH TECHNOLOGY USING INP HEMT TO ALLOW 1/F NOISE REDUCTION IN FRONT-END LOW NOISE AMPLIFIER (LNAS) INTEGRATED ONTO THE SAME INTEGRATED CIRCUIT (IC). BOTH DEVELOPMENTS WILL BE DONE ON NGC INP 25NM HEMT TECHNOLOGY BY DESIGNING AND PROCESSING A DEDICATED FOUNDRY RUN FOR THIS PROJECT. NGC AND JPL WILL WORK CLOSELY ON THE DESIGN OF THE COMPONENTS  PACKAGING AND TESTING  AND ANALYSIS OF THE RADIOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS. IRAST IS EXPECTED TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS FOR ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE. THE INTEGRATED RECEIVER FOR TEMPERATURE AND WATER VAPOR PROFILING OF THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE WILL PROVIDE DETAILED INFORMATION OF THE ATMOSPHERE BETWEEN 6 TO 16 KM IN TROPICAL ATMOSPHERE AND WILL INCREASE NADIR RESOLUTION AND WILL REDUCE APERTURE SIZE WHEN USED FOR LIMB SOUNDING. THE INTEGRATED SWITCH TECHNOLOGY WILL IMPROVE CLOUD ICE MEASUREMENTS BY REDUCING THE 1/F NOICE CONTRIBUTION IN LOW DC POWER DIRECT DETECTION RECEIVERS BEING DEVELOPED ON TWICE AND INTENDED FOR APPLICATION TO ENTICE. APPLICATION OF 25 NM INP HEMT TECHNOLOGY TO BOTH OF THESE PROBLEMS WILL PROVIDE A SCIENTIFIC SOLUTION WITH CONSIDERABLE BENEFITS OVER EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES IN TERMS OF SIZE  WEIGHT  AND POWER (SWAP) ENABLED BOTH BY THE HIGH LEVEL OF INTEGRATION WHICH IS BOUGHT BY MMIC TECHNOLOGY AND DC POWER SAVINGS. WE ESTIMATE THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE TEMPERATURE AND WATER VAPOR PROFILING RECEIVER TO CONSUME APPROXIMATELY 1 W OF DC POWER EXCLUDING THE X-BAND LO. 660 GHZ DIRECT DETECTION RECEIVERS CONSUME APPROXIMATELY 120 MW  COMPARED TO 6-10 W OF DC POWER CONSUMED BY A HETERODYNE RECEIVER IN GAAS SCHOTTKY TECHNOLOGY. THEREFORE  BOTH OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE IDEAL CUBESAT APPLICATIONS. THE UPPER ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY SOUNDING RECEIVER WILL BE DEVELOPED BY JPL USING PROVEN MODELS FOR 25 NM INP HEMT PROVIDED BY NGC. TWO FULL DESIGN ITERATIONS WILL BE COMPLETED BY JPL  ALONG WITH CORRESPONDING DESIGN  LAYOUT  COMPONENT MEASUREMENTS  AND RECEIVER VALIDATION. DEVELOPMENT WILL START FROM LNA S DEVELOPED ON IRAD. THE LNA WILL BE INTEGRATED WITH AN I-Q MIXER WHICH WILL ALLOW SEPARATION OF BOTH THE 424 GHZ OXYGEN LINE AND THE 448 GHZ WATER VAPOR LINE. THE INTEGRATED DICKE SWITCHES WILL BE DEVELOPED BY NGC USING IRAD DESIGNS WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN ANALYZED AND LAYOUTS CREATED. NGCS SECOND DESIGN ITERATION WILL BE AIDED BY DEVICE MODELING. THE DICKIE SWITCHES WILL BE COMBINED WITH EXISTING DIRECT DETECTION RECEIVERS AND RADIOMETRIC PERFORMANCE WILL BE EVALUATED. IMPACT TO RECEIVER SENSITIVITY WILL BE MANAGED BY PLACING AN ADDITIONAL BALANCED LAN IN FRONT OF THE DICKE SWITCH. THIS TECHNIQUE HAS BEEN PROVED AT W-BAND AND REDUCES THE1/F NOISE CONTRIBUTION OF THE ADDITIONAL LNA. TWO MMIC DESIGN ITERATIONS ARE BUDGETED INTO NGC S 25 NM INP HEMT PROCESS. THE PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE FOR IRAST IS 24 MONTHS. THIS ALLOWS TIME FOR THE TWO FULL DESIGN ITERATIONS  WAFER PROCESSING  AND RECEIVER VALIDATION. WITH THE UNDERLYING SEMICONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY ALREADY IN EXISTENCE  AND MODELS SHOWING THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED IRAST TASKS  ENTRY TRL LEVEL IS TRL2. IRAST WILL COMPLETE WITH PACKAGED RECEIVER MEASUREMENTS IN A LABORATORY ENVIRONMENT. THEREFORE  EXIT TRL IS TRL4. THIS REPRESENTS A TWO LEVEL TRL INCREASE OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD.

"G & A TECHNICAL SOFTWARE INC","","United States","","","","","THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WOULD ADDRESS SMALL-SCALE GRAVITY WAVE  INSTABILITY  AND TURBULENCE DYNAMICS THAT PLAY CENTRAL ROLES IN THE TRANSPORT AND DEPOSITION OF ENERGY AND MOMENTUM THROUGHOUT THE ATMOSPHERE. THESE DYNAMICS ARE KEY TO DEFINING THE LARGE- AND SMALLER-SCALE STRUCTURE AND VARIABILITY OF THE MLT  AND THEIR NEUTRAL AND IONOSPHERIC INFLUENCES EXTENDING TO HIGHER ALTITUDES. DESPITE THEIR IMPORTANCE  AND NUMEROUS PREVIOUS STUDIES  THESE DYNAMICS ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD AT PRESENT. MULTIPLE ROCKET AND GROUND-BASED STUDIES HAVE PROVIDED IMPORTANT ADVANCES DEFINING LARGER-SCALE ENVIRONMENTS AND GRAVITY WAVES  THE TYPES AND SCALES OF INSTABILITIES  AND MEASURES OF THE INTENSITY AND VARIABILITY OF TURBULENCE AT SMALLER SPATIAL SCALES. HOWEVER  NO PREVIOUS EXPERIMENT HAS SIMULTANEOUSLY DEFINED 1) THE SPATIAL CONTEXT OF THE DRIVING GRAVITY WAVE AND INSTABILITY DYNAMICS OVER EXTENDED HORIZONTAL SCALES  2) THE TRANSITION FROM LARGER-SCALE INSTABILITIES TO TURBULENCE  AND 3) THE EVOLVING INSTABILITY AND TURBULENCE CHARACTER EXTENDING TO THE TURBULENCE  INNER  SCALE CONTINUOUSLY IN TIME THROUGHOUT THE EVENT. SERENDIPITOUS IMAGING OF SMALL-SCALE INSTABILITY AND TURBULENCE STRUCTURES IN POLAR MESOSPHERIC CLOUDS (PMCS) BY STAR CAMERAS SUPPORTING THE EBEX STRATOSPHERIC BALLOON EXPERIMENT HAS DEMONSTRATED THE POTENTIAL FOR SUCH OBSERVATIONS. THESE IMAGES REVEAL INSTABILITY AND TURBULENCE DYNAMICS EXTENDING FROM A FEW KM TO ~10-20 M SCALES (PIXEL RESOLUTION OF 3 M) AND OFFER A NEW WINDOW ON THESE DYNAMICS THAT WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY POSSIBLE WITH ANY MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE. THE KEYS TO THIS SENSITIVITY LIE IN THE VERY THIN PMC LAYER BRIGHTNESS WHERE ADVECTION CAUSES STRONG PMC THINNING AND IMAGING FROM ABOVE ATMOSPHERIC TURBULENCE AT LOWER ALTITUDES. OUR PROPOSED EXPERIMENT WOULD EXPAND PMC IMAGING CAPABILITIES SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY. NEW IMAGING USING VERY-HIGH-RESOLUTION (50 MPIXEL) DETECTORS AND CO-ALIGNED WIDE AND NARROW FIELDS OF VIEW (FOV) WOULD EXTEND HORIZONTAL SPATIAL COVERAGE FROM ~100 KM TO ~10-M SCALES WITH IMAGING RESOLUTION AS HIGH AS 2 M. A FIXED ANTI-SUN VIEWING PLATFORM WOULD ALLOW TRACKING OF ENTIRE EVENTS THROUGHOUT THEIR EVOLUTION EXTENDING MANY BUOYANCY PERIODS (E.G.  AN HOUR OR LONGER) WITH 2-S RESOLUTION. HIGH-RESOLUTION MODELING OF GRAVITY WAVE  INSTABILITY  AND TURBULENCE DYNAMICS THAT HAS ALREADY YIELDED TANTALIZING COMPARISONS OF SIMULATED AND OBSERVED DYNAMICS WOULD BE EMPLOYED TO GUIDE QUANTIFICATION OF THE OBSERVED EVENTS. THE FLIGHT PROGRAM WOULD UTILIZE A SMALL OR MID-SIZE CONSTANT-PRESSURE BALLOON FLOWN FROM MCMURDO STATION  ANTARCTICA FOR A FLIGHT OF 1-2 WEEKS ALLOWING ONE ORBIT AROUND THE ANTARCTIC VORTEX IN AUSTRAL SUMMER. A LAUNCH WINDOW FROM 15/12/2017 TO 15/01/2018 WOULD GUARANTEE HIGH SENSITIVITY BY OUR IMAGERS TO THE MULTI-SCALE DYNAMICS REVEALED IN PMC IMAGERY. THE EXPERIMENT WOULD LEVERAGE EBEX IMAGING HERITAGE  THE PROVEN CSBF SOLAR POWER AND COURSE POINTING SYSTEMS  AND ELECTRONICS AND SOFTWARE TO MINIMIZE RISK IN COST AND THE DEVELOPMENT TIMESCALE. THE ENTIRE PAYLOAD WOULD WEIGH ~1000 LBS  FACILITATING A RELATIVELY SIMPLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE LAUNCH. MINIMUM TELEMETRY WOULD BE NEEDED TO EVALUATE IMAGER PERFORMANCE DURING THE MISSION  WITH DATA STORED ONBOARD UNTIL RETRIEVAL OF THE PAYLOAD FOLLOWING THE MEASUREMENT PROGRAM. THE PAYLOAD WOULD BE DELIVERED TO THE NASA BALLOON FACILITY IN PALESTINE  TX FOR TESTING AND SHIPPING TO MCMURDO ~4 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ANTICIPATED LAUNCH WINDOW. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WOULD HAVE SPECIFIC RELEVANCE TO GOALS 2 AND 4 IN THE RECENT HELIOPHYSICS DECADAL SURVEY  SOLAR AND SPACE PHYSICS: A SCIENCE FOR A TECHNOLOGICAL SOCIETY: - DETERMINE THE DYNAMICS AND COUPLING OF EARTH S MAGNETOSPHERE  IONOSPHERE  AND ATMOSPHERE AND THEIR RESPONSE TO SOLAR AND TERRESTRIAL INPUTS  - DISCOVER AND CHARACTERIZE FUNDAMENTAL PROCESSES THAT OCCUR BOTH WITHIN THE HELIOSPHERE AND THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE.","","2018","$387,139","$0","$387,139","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Virginia", "","","","",""

THE OBJECTIVES OF THE ISS-MOP PROJECT ARE TO MEASURE PRESENCE OF VIRAL AND SELECT BACTERIAL AND FUNGAL PATHOGENS AND CORRELATE THEIR PRESENCE ON CREW. THE EFFECTS OF THE SPACEFLIGHT ENVIRONMENT ON VIRAL AND MICROBIAL PATHOGEN DYNAMICS ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN AND REPRESENT BOTH A SIGNIFICANT GAP IN OUR KNOWLEDGE AND AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY THE PRESENCE OF MICROBIAL POPULATIONS AND PREDICT HEALTH RISKS DURING LONG-TERM SPACE EXPLORATION. THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE ISS-MOP PROJECT IS THAT CERTAIN SHORT-LIVING VIRUSES ASSOCIATED WITH INERT ENVIRONMENTAL SPACES IN THE CLOSED HABITAT OF THE ISS CAN HAVE AN ADVERSE INFLUENCE ON CREW HEALTH. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS THE TEAM WILL CATALOGUE VIRUSES ASSOCIATED WITH SURFACES AND AIR OF THE ISS MODULES USING THE ALL-ENCOMPASSING LAWRENCE LIVERMORE MICROBIAL DETECTION ARRAY (LLMDA)  WHICH CONTAINS PROBES TO DETECT NOT ONLY VIRUSES BUT ALSO CLINICALLY IMPORTANT HUMAN BACTERIAL AND FUNGAL PATHOGENS. IN ADDITION  SKIN AND SALIVA SAMPLES FROM CREWMEMBERS WILL BE REQUESTED TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS. THERE ARE THREE AIMS PROPOSED IN THIS ISS-MOP PROJECT. WHILE THE CULTIVATION-BASED ASSAY (AIM 1) PROVIDES A VALID ESTIMATION OF MICROBIAL PRESENCE  IT OFFERS ONLY A LIMITED ASSESSMENT OF THE PHYLOGENETIC/PATHOGENIC DIVERSITY AND PHYSIOLOGICAL BREADTH OF THE MICROBIAL POPULATION PRESENT. THEREFORE  THE TEAM WILL USE THE NOVEL AND COMPREHENSIVE LLMDA MICROARRAY  THAT IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO ELUCIDATE THE PATHOGENIC VIRAL AND MICROBIAL DIVERSITY PROFILES OF COMPLEX SAMPLES TO AT LEAST THE SPECIES LEVEL (AIM 2). IN ADDITION  WE WILL CHARACTERIZE THE VIRULENCE AND ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE MECHANISMS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PATHOGENS FROM THE ISS BY DEVELOPING A NEW VIRULENCE AND ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE GENE ARRAY AND ANALYZE THE SAMPLES ON THIS ARRAY. THE FINAL DELIVERABLE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT TO NASA WILL BE THE ISS-MOP DATASET  A COMPILATION OF ALL OF THE GENOMIC SEQUENCES AND GENETIC INFORMATION OF VIRUSES AND MICROBES ENCOUNTERED ON AND WITHIN THE ISS HABITAT (AIM 3).","","2018","$398,106","$0","$398,106","NASA Space Operations Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.007","","California", "California","USA","joint venture (owned by Bechtel, University of California, Babcock and Wilcox, URS, and Battelle)","miscellaneous services","outsourced government services"

"BC SCIENTIFIC CONSULTING LLC","","United States","","","","","THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO EXTEND LONG-TERM MICROWAVE MIDDLE ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENTS OF OZONE  CHLORINE MONOXIDE  AND WATER VAPOR WHICH HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED BY NASA AND HAVE BEEN PART OF THE NETWORK FOR ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION CHANGE (NDACC) SINCE THE EARLY 1990 S. THE MEASUREMENT DATABASE CONSISTS OF O3 AND H2O MEASUREMENTS FROM MAUNA LOA  HAWAII  AND LAUDER  NEW ZEALAND; CLO MEASUREMENTS FROM MAUNA KEA  HAWAII AND SCOTT BASE  ANTARCTICA; AND H2O MEASUREMENTS FROM TABLE MOUNTAIN  CALIFORNIA. ALL THREE OF THESE SPECIES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE CLIMATE SYSTEM. OZONE MEASUREMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL TO MONITOR THE BEGINNING OF ITS RECOVERY  AND CLO MEASUREMENTS ARE NEEDED TO INTERPRET THIS PROCESS. WATER VAPOR IS THE RESERVOIR OF ODD HYDROGEN IN THE MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE  AND IS THEREFORE ALSO IMPORTANT TO OZONE CHEMISTRY. IT HAS ALSO BEEN SUGGESTED THAT VARIATIONS IN STRATOSPHERIC H2O HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON DECADAL-SCALE GLOBAL SURFACE CLIMATE CHANGE. TO ILLUSTRATE THE SCIENTIFIC VALUE OF THESE MEASUREMENTS WE DISCUSS SEVERAL STUDIES CONDUCTED DURING THE 2013-2017 PROPOSAL CYCLE WHICH MAKE USE OF THESE LONG-TERM DATASETS. THESE INCLUDED LONG-TERM TREND STUDIES OF CLO OVER MAUNA KEA [CONNOR ET AL.  2013]  STUDIES OF H2O OVER BOTH MAUNA LOA AND TABLE MOUNTAIN [NEDOLUHA ET AL. 2013A; NEDOLUHA ET AL. 2013B]  A STUDY OF DIURNAL O3 VARIATIONS OVER MAUNA LOA [PARRISH ET AL. 2014]  AND STUDIES OF THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING ATMOSPHERIC DYNAMICS ON O3 [NEDOLUHA ET AL.  2015A; NEDOLUHA ET AL. 2015B]. IN ADDITION  A MANUSCRIPT RELATED TO LONG-TERM TRENDS IN CLO OVER SCOTT BASE HAS BEEN SUBMITTED [NEDOLUHA ET AL. 2016]. FINALLY  THE DATA HAS AND IS BEING USED IN A NUMBER OF STUDIES LED BY OTHER AUTHORS. THE MOST IMPORTANT GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO MAINTAIN STABLE MEASUREMENTS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE ACCURATE DETECTION OF LONG-TERM CHANGE. IN ORDER TO ENSURE CONTINUED STABLE OPERATION INSTRUMENTS NEED TO BE UPDATED. THIS WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN THE INSTRUMENTS WITH CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY AND WILL REDUCE THE LONG-TERM MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS SO THAT WE CAN KEEP THEM OPERATING WITH A SINGLE FIELD ENGINEER AND SOME ON-SITE SUPPORT. THE H2O INSTRUMENTS UNDERWENT SIGNIFICANT UPDATES DURING THE 2009-2013 PROPOSAL CYCLE  AND HAVE REQUIRED MINIMAL TECHNICAL ATTENTION DURING THE 2013-2017 PROPOSAL CYCLE. DURING THE 2013-2017 PROPOSAL CYCLE WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN MAJOR UPGRADES OF THE O3 INSTRUMENT AT MAUNA LOA AND A CLO INSTRUMENT WHICH  BECAUSE OF ANTI-TELESCOPE PROTESTS  HAD TO BE MOVED FROM MAUNA KEA TO MAUNA LOA. WHILE THE O3 INSTRUMENT HAS NOT YET UNDERGONE A FULL VALIDATION STUDY  SEVERAL MONTHS OF RETRIEVALS AND COMPARISONS WITH AURA MLS SUGGEST THAT IT IS OPERATING SATISFACTORILY. THERE ARE SEVERAL MAJOR TECHNICAL TASKS WHICH WE PLAN TO ACCOMPLISH IN THE 2017-2021 TIMEFRAME. WE PLAN TO REPLACE THE CRYOGENICALLY OPERATING O3 RECEIVERS AT MAUNA LOA AND LAUDER WITH ROOM TEMPERATURE VERSIONS  JUST AS HAS BEEN DONE FOR THE H2O SYSTEMS. WHILE THIS MAY RESULT IN SOME LOSS OF SIGNAL-TO-NOISE  AND WILL RESULT IN AN INTERRUPTION OF MEASUREMENTS AT LAUDER  ARE NOT  IN GENERAL  SIGNALTO- NOISE LIMITED  AND IT WILL PUT THEM ON A MORE SUSTAINABLE LONG-TERM FOOTING. WE HAVE RETRIEVED CLO WITH THE NEW INSTRUMENT NOW ON MAUNA LOA  AND THE INSTRUMENT APPEARS TO BE OPERATING VERY WELL  BUT IT IS NOT YET CLEAR WHETHER CONDITIONS AT THIS SITE  WHICH ARE SOMEWHAT POORER THAN ON MAUNA KEA  WILL ALLOW US TO MAKE SUFFICIENT TRENDQUALITY CLO MEASUREMENTS. WE ARE CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING OPTIONS TO RETURN TO MAUNA KEA IN THE EVENT THAT CONDITIONS AT MAUNA LOA ARE FOUND TO BE NOT FULLY SATISFACTORY. THE CHALLENGE OF REPLACING THE AGING SCOTT BASE CLO INSTRUMENT IS THE MOST DAUNTING. AS A FIRST STEP TO THIS WE HAVE NEARLY FINISHED DEVELOPING A NEW CHLOE INSTRUMENT IN THE LAB AT NRL. THIS INSTRUMENT WILL FIRST BE DEPLOYED TO HAWAII  AND  AFTER COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE TWO CLO INSTRUMENTS IN HAWAII WE WILL MOVE ONE TO SCOTT BASE.","","2018","$466,037","$0","$466,037","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","New York", "","","","",""

"LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION","Lockheed Martin","United States","","","","","CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS (CMES) AND LARGE SOLAR FLARES PRODUCE THE STRONGEST SPACE WEATHER DISTURBANCES  AND ARE DRIVEN BY THE RELEASE OF STORED MAGNETIC ENERGY LOW IN THE SOLAR CORONA. SINCE THE BUILD UP OF CORONAL MAGNETIC ENERGY IS INDUCED BY MAGNETIC EVOLUTION AT THE PHOTOSPHERE  THE ABILITY TO USE OBSERVATIONS OF THE EVOLVING PHOTOSPHERIC MAGNETIC FIELD TO DRIVE A TIME-DEPENDENT MODEL OF THE CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD HAS LONG BEEN A GOAL OF BOTH NASA'S LIVING WITH A STAR (LWS) PROGRAM AND THE MULTI-AGENCY NATIONAL SPACE WEATHER PROGRAM (NSWP)  WITH THE AIMS OF BOTH UNDERSTANDING HOW CMES AND FLARES WORK AND PREDICTING SUCH EVENTS. HERE  WE --- A COLLABORATIVE TEAM FROM UC BERKELEY  STANFORD  AND LOCKHEED-MARTIN --- DEMONSTRATE PRECISELY THIS ABILITY  USING SEQUENCES OF VECTOR MAGNETOGRAMS AND DOPPLERGRAMS FROM THE HELIOSEISMIC AND MAGNETIC IMAGER (HMI) INSTRUMENT ABOARD THE LWS PROGRAM'S SOLAR DYNAMICS OBSERVATORY TO DRIVE A MAGNETOFRICTIONAL (MF) MODEL OF THE CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD IN AR 11158  WHICH PRODUCED AN X2.2 FLARE. DURING A THREE-DAY SIMULATION RUN  MAGNETIC ENERGY IN THE MODEL FIELD INCREASED STEADILY  AND THE MODEL FIELD ERUPTED AT A TIME IN THE DATA SEQUENCE COINCIDENT WITH THE ACTUAL FLARE. WE PROPOSE TO IMPLEMENT THIS MF MODEL IN SPHERICAL COORDINATES  TO ENABLE REAL-TIME  LONG-TERM MODELING OF THE NON-POTENTIAL CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD  BOTH GLOBALLY AND FOR ACTIVE REGION (ARS). THE MODEL'S EARTH-FACING HEMISPHERE WILL BE DRIVEN USING ELECTRIC FIELDS DERIVED FROM THE OBSERVED EVOLUTION OF PHOTOSPHERIC LINE-OF-SIGHT MAGNETIC FIELDS AND ELECTRIC CURRENTS. FAR-SIDE DATA INPUTS WILL BE FROM AN EXISTING FLUX TRANSPORT CODE  COMBINED WITH HMI FAR-SIDE OBSERVATIONS OF NEW ACTIVE REGIONS  WITH EMPIRICAL PARAMETRIZATIONS OF ORIENTATION AND FLUX. BECAUSE THIS MODEL INCLUDES LARGE-SCALE CORONAL ELECTRIC CURRENTS  IT IS A SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT OVER EXISTING REAL-TIME GLOBAL CORONAL MODELS  WHICH ASSUME POTENTIAL FIELDS. DATA PRODUCTS AVAILABLE FROM THE MODEL INCLUDE: 1) THE EVOLVING PHOTOSPHERIC ELECTRIC FIELD  POYNTING FLUX  AND HELICITY FLUX; 2) ESTIMATES OF CORONAL FREE ENERGY AND NON-POTENTIAL GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY; 3) INITIAL AND TIME-DEPENDENT BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR MHD MODELING OF ACTIVE REGIONS; AND 4) TIME-DEPENDENT BOUNDARY CONDITIONS AND FLUX TUBE EXPANSION FACTORS FOR MHD AND EMPIRICAL SOLAR WIND MODELS. UNSTABLE CONFIGURATIONS FOUND FROM MF MODELS WILL BE DYNAMICALLY EVOLVED WITH LOCAL AND GLOBAL MHD CODES. MODULES USED TO DERIVE SURFACE ELECTRIC FIELDS FROM MAGNETIC EVOLUTION WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE HMI DATA PIPELINE  AND DATA PRODUCTS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE JSOC AND DIRECTLY TO SPACE WEATHER FORECASTERS AND USERS. THE ELECTRIC FIELD AND MF CODES WILL BE DELIVERED TO THE CCMC FOR SCIENCE ANALYSIS AND USE WITH OTHER MODELS. INTELLECTUAL MERIT: BY INCLUDING ELECTRIC CURRENTS IN MODELING LONGTERM CORONAL EVOLUTION DRIVEN BY PHOTOSPHERIC EVOLUTION  OUR MAGNETOFRICTIONAL MODEL WILL IMPROVE OUR CAPABILITY TO STUDY BOTH HOW THE CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD RESPONDS TO CONDITIONS AT THE SOLAR SURFACE  AND HOW AND WHERE MAGNETIC ENERGY IS STORED IN THE CORONA. BROADER IMPACTS: THIS MODEL WILL REPRESENT AN IMPROVED FIDELITY OVER EXISTING POTENTIAL-FIELD GLOBAL SOLAR MODELS  AND WILL RESULT IN AN IMPROVED ABILITY TO MODEL AND PREDICT SPACE-WEATHER EVENTS AND CONDITIONS  AND THEREBY LEAD TO BETTER SPACE-WEATHER FORECASTING.","","2018","$468,469","$0","$468,469","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","California", "Maryland","USA","publicly traded","aerospace and military contracting","aerospace & military contracting"

"ATMOSPHERIC & SPACE TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH ASSOCIATES","","United States","","","","","THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED CUBESAT MISSION IS TO INVESTIGATE THE UNDERLYING CAUSES BEHIND THE APPEARANCE OF F-REGION PLASMA STRUCTURES AND THE EVOLUTION OF THESE STRUCTURES AFTER FORMATION. OUR APPROACH TO ADDRESS THIS COMPLEX CHALLENGE PLACES SENSORS THAT MEASURE KEY PLASMA PARAMETERS IN A CIRCULAR  LOW TO MIDDLE INCLINATION ORBIT NEAR 400 KM ALTITUDE TO STUDY THE CORRELATION BETWEEN CONVECTION ELECTRIC FIELD VARIATIONS AND PLASMA DENSITIES AT DIFFERENT LOCAL TIMES AND LONGITUDES. TO DO THIS  MEASUREMENTS OF ION-DRIFTS AND PLASMA DENSITIES WILL BE MADE BY A MINIATURE ION VELOCITY METER AND A MICRO PLANAR LANGMUIR PROBE. THESE INSTRUMENTS WILL FLY ON A 6U CUBESAT WITH PRECISE 3-AXIS ATTITUDE CONTROL AND BODY MOUNTED SOLAR PANELS. THE SORTIE CUBESAT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF ALREADY MATURED CUBESAT TECHNOLOGIES AND REQUIRES NO DEPLOYABLE MECHANISMS. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES SCIENCE QUESTIONS IN THE NASA HELIOPHYSICS ROADMAP (2009) INCLUDING (A) UNDERSTANDING THE GLOBAL AND LOCAL ELECTRODYNAMICS OF THE ITM SYSTEM IN RESPONSE TO GEOMAGNETIC DYNAMICS AND (B) DISCOVERING THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES IN THE IONOSPHERE-THERMOSPHERE SYSTEM THROUGH RECURRENT MEASUREMENTS OF IONOSPHERIC IRREGULARITIES AND THE BACKGROUND CONDITIONS IN WHICH THEY FORM. WE EXPECT THAT THE PROPOSED MISSION WILL ADVANCE THE CAPABILITY TO PREDICT THE APPEARANCE OF LOW-LATITUDE IONOSPHERIC IRREGULARITIES BY OBSERVING THE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS THAT LEAD TO THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND EXAMINING THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ANY PRE-EXISTING WAVE STRUCTURES AND THE SPECTRAL CONTENT OF THE IRREGULARITIES THAT APPEAR AFTER SUNSET.","","2018","$475,779","$0","$475,779","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Colorado", "","","","",""

"STRATTON PARK ENGINEERING CO.  INC.","","United States","","","","","THE IMPACT OF HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF ANTHROPOGENIC AEROSOLS (E.G.  POLLUTION FROM BURNING OF BIOMASS AND/OR FOSSIL FUELS) ON CUMULUS CLOUDS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE MAGNITUDE OF PRECIPITATION AND TRANSPORT OF ICE PARTICLES INTO THE UPPER TROPOSPHERE/LOWER STRATOSPHERE (UTLS). PRECIPITATION IS CRITICAL TO AGRICULTURE AND OTHER SOCIAL ECONOMIC DISCIPLINES; THE TRANSPORT OF WATER VAPOR (EVAPORATED ICE) INTO THE UTLS HAS A SERIOUS IMPACT ON GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. WE WILL CONDUCT INTENSIVE IN SITU OBSERVATIONS OF AEROSOLS  CLOUD MICROPHYSICS AND UPDRAFT DYNAMICS USING THE NASA P-3B AND SPEC LEARJET RESEARCH AIRCRAFT. SPEC WILL BRING A LEARJET MODEL 35 TO THE FIELD  OPERATE IT AND MAINTAIN AND PROCESS DATA FROM ADVANCED CLOUD MICROPHYSICS SENSORS INSTALLED ON BOTH THE P-3B AND LEARJET. THE OBSERVATIONS WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) CLOUD SIMULATIONS USING A BIN MICROPHYSICS SCHEME IN CONJUNCTION WITH A NOVEL MICROPHYSICAL PIGGYBACKING  APPROACH TO SHED LIGHT ON THE MECHANISM(S) RESPONSIBLE FOR CLOUD MODIFICATION DUE TO ENHANCED AEROSOL LOADING. THE MAIN IDEA OF  MICROPHYSICAL PIGGYBACKING  IS TO APPLY TWO SETS OF THERMODYNAMIC VARIABLES (THE POTENTIAL TEMPERATURE  WATER VAPOR MIXING RATIO  AND ALL VARIABLES DESCRIBING AEROSOL  CLOUD AND PRECIPITATION PARTICLES) IN A SINGLE CLOUD FIELD SIMULATION. THE FIRST SET IS COUPLED TO THE DYNAMICS AND DRIVES THE SIMULATION AND THE SECOND SET PIGGYBACKS THE SIMULATED FLOW AND DOES NOT AFFECT IT. THE METHODOLOGY ALLOWS FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACTS WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED ACCURACY  AND IT IS CAPABLE OF DETECTING EVEN MINUSCULE IMPACTS ON BULK CLOUD PROPERTIES SUCH AS THE CLOUD COVER  LIQUID AND ICE WATER PATH  AND SURFACE PRECIPITATION. THE IMPACT ON THE DYNAMICS IS ASSESSED BY PERFORMING A SECOND SIMULATION WITH MICROPHYSICAL SETS SWAPPED SO THE DRIVER SET BECOMES THE PIGGYBACKING SET  AND VICE VERSA. IF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RESULTS FROM DRIVER AND PIGGYBACKING SETS IN THE TWO SIMULATIONS (I.E.  IN THE ORIGINAL SIMULATION AND IN THE ONE WITH SETS SWAPPED) ARE THE SAME EXCEPT FOR THE SIGN  THEN THE CLOUD DYNAMICS IS ARGUABLY INSIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE CLOUD MICROPHYSICS. WE EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS AN INTERPRETIVE MODELING COMPONENT AND NOT STAND-ALONE; THE MODEL WILL BE INTEGRATED WITH THE OBSERVATIONS TO QUANTIFY MICROPHYSICAL AND DYNAMICAL IMPACTS OF AEROSOLS AS A PART OF OUR DATA ANALYSIS APPROACH  AND TO ASSESS RADIATIVE IMPACTS. THE LEAR 35 PROPOSED FOR CAMP2EX HAS TURBOFAN ENGINES AND IS AN UPGRADE FROM SPEC S LEAR 25 THAT HAS TURBOJET ENGINES. THE LEAR 35 HAS A 2 000 NMI RANGE AND WILL BE CAPABLE OF WORKING WITH THE P-3B UP TO ABOUT 400 NMI OFFSHORE. THE BASIC MEASUREMENT APPROACH IS FOR THE P-3B TO MAKE SUBCLOUD MEASUREMENTS OF AEROSOLS AND AIR MOTIONS BEFORE CLIMBING INTO WARM CLOUD TO MAKE MICROPHYSICS MEASUREMENTS. THE LEARJET WILL FIRST PENETRATE CLOUD NEAR THE FREEZING LEVEL AND THEN CONTINUE TO CLIMB AND PENETRATE THE UPDRAFT CORE UNTIL THE CLOUD IS GLACIATED. THE ABILITY OF THE LEARJET TO CLIMB AT RATES UP TO 5 000 FPM (21 M S-1) ALLOWS IT TO CLIMB AND PENETRATE THE SAME REGION OF THE UPDRAFT CORE  PRODUCING A QUASI-LANGRANGIAN DOCUMENTATION OF THE UPDRAFT. ANALYSIS OF P3-B AND LEARJET MICROPHYSICAL DATA WILL BE CONDUCTED BY AN EXPERIENCED COMPLEMENT OF SPEC SCIENTISTS (DRS. LAWSON  WOODS  GURGANUS  MO AND RODEN). DRS. MORRISON AND GRABOWSKI FROM NCAR PLAY A MAJOR (FUNDED) ROLE IN DATA ANALYSIS AND INTEGRATION OF THE NOVEL PIGGYBACKING MODEL METHODOLOGY. DR. ROELOF BRUINTJES FROM NCAR AND PRECIPITATION PHYSICS CONSULTANTS WILL PARTICIPATE AS FLIGHT SCIENTIST AND DATA ANALYSIS. DR. SEBASTIAN SCHMIDT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO (CU) AND DR. MELODY AVERY FROM NASA LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER ARE COLLABORATORS ON THIS PROPOSAL.","","2018","$496,552","$0","$496,552","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Colorado", "","","","",""

"TENAGRA OBSERVATORIES  LTD.","","United States","","","","","WE PROPOSE TO UTILIZE 100% OF THE TIME ON THE TENAGRA II 0.81-M F/7 RITCHEY-CHR TIEN TELESCOPE AND ON THE TENAGRA III 0.41-M F/3.75 ASTROGRAPH (NEAR RIO RICO  AZ) TO PERFORM ASTROMETRIC OBSERVATIONS OF NEOS  WITH THE PRIMARY GOALS OF (A) CONFIRMING NEWLY DISCOVERED NEO CANDIDATES POSTED ON THE NEO CONFIRMATION PAGE (NEOCP)  CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR INITIAL ORBIT AND ABSOLUTE MAGNITUDE DETERMINATION  (B) EXTENDING THE OBSERVED ARCS OF RECENTLY DISCOVERED NEOS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE DURING THEIR DISCOVERY APPARITIONS  AND (C) RECOVERING SINGLE-OPPOSITION NEOS AT A SECOND APPARITION. CURRENTLY  50% OF THE 0.81-M TELESCOPE'S TIME IS BEING USED FOR NEO OBSERVATIONS  WHICH RESULTED IN 3 000 NEO OBSERVATIONS AND 26 RECOVERIES OF ONE-OPPOSITION NEOS BETWEEN LATE SEPTEMBER 2013 AND EARLY APRIL 2014. THE 0.81-M TELESCOPE IS FULLY AUTOMATED  AND CAN DETECT NEOS DOWN TO V ~ 21.5-21.7 IN UP TO ~ 10 MIN OF EXPOSURE  IN MOST CASES WITH SINGLE EXPOSURES TRACKED ON THE TARGET'S MOTION. THIS MAKES NEARLY ALL OBJECTS CURRENTLY BEING POSTED ON THE NEOCP ACCESSIBLE TO OBSERVATION. THE 0.41-M TELESCOPE  ALSO FULLY AUTOMATED  HAS A 1.35 DEGREE X 1.35 DEGREE FIELD-OF VIEW WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR FOLLOW-UP AND RECOVERIES OF NEOS DOWN TO V ~ 20.8 HAVING EPHEMERIS UNCERTAINTIES UP TO TENS OF DEGREES.  TO MAXIMIZE THE RELEVANCE OF EACH NIGHT'S OBSERVATIONS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OR NEO ORBITS  TARGET SELECTION TAKES INTO ACCOUNT PARAMETERS SUCH AS EPHEMERIS UNCERTAINTIES  OBSERVED ARCS  LENGTHS OF OBSERVABILITY WINDOWS  AND NEOCP SCORES. FULLY AUTOMATED IMAGE ACQUISITION AND EFFICIENT OBSERVATION SCHEDULING MINIMIZE TELESCOPE IDLE TIME AND MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF NEO OBSERVATIONS PER NIGHT. UNATTENDED REAL-TIME MOVING OBJECT DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION IS DONE ON SITE WITH THE HELP OF A PIPELINE (SKYSIFT)  ALLOWING FAST HUMAN VALIDATION/REJECTION OF THE RESULTING DETECTIONS  AS WELL AS RAPID SUBMISSION OF NEO DETECTIONS TO THE MPC  HELPING AVOID DUPLICATION OF OBSERVATIONS BY OTHER STATIONS. THE PIPELINE'S IMAGE SUBTRACTION ALGORITHM INCREASES DETECTION EFFICIENCY IN CROWDED FIELDS AND IN FIELDS WHERE STARS LEAVE LONG TRAILS DUE TO TRACKING ON A FAST TARGET'S MOTION. AUTOMATED DETECTION IS SUPPLEMENTED WHEN NECESSARY BY VISUAL CHECKING OF IMAGES AND MANUAL MEASUREMENT OF TARGET POSITIONS. A PROPOSED CAMERA UPGRADE FOR THE 0.81-M TELESCOPE IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE A 50-60% INCREASE IN THAT TELESCOPE'S PRODUCTIVITY. THE PROPOSED NEO OBSERVATION PROGRAM IS RELEVANT TO SUPPORT NASA-FUNDED NEO SURVEYS  ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE EXPECTED SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE NEO DISCOVERY RATES OF THE MAJOR SURVEYS (CSS AND PAN-STARRS) IN THE NEAR FUTURE.","","2018","$511,287","$0","$511,287","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Oregon", "","","","",""

"G & A TECHNICAL SOFTWARE INC","","United States","","","","","THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WOULD ADDRESS SMALL SCALE GRAVITY WAVE  INSTABILITY  AND TURBULENCE DYNAMICS THAT PLAY CENTRAL ROLES IN THE TRANSPORT AND DEPOSITION OF ENERGY AND MOMENTUM THROUGHOUT THE ATMOSPHERE. THESE DYNAMICS ARE KEY TO DEFINING THE LARGE  AND SMALLER SCALE STRUCTURE AND VARIABILITY OF THE MLT  AND THEIR NEUTRAL AND IONOSPHERIC INFLUENCES EXTENDING TO HIGHER ALTITUDES. DESPITE THEIR IMPORTANCE  AND NUMEROUS PREVIOUS STUDIES  THESE DYNAMICS ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD AT PRESENT.  MULTIPLE ROCKET AND GROUND BASED STUDIES HAVE PROVIDED IMPORTANT ADVANCES DEFINING LARGER SCALE ENVIRONMENTS AND GRAVITY WAVES  THE TYPES AND SCALES OF INSTABILITIES  AND MEASURES OF THE INTENSITY AND VARIABILITY OF TURBULENCE AT SMALLER SPATIAL SCALES. HOWEVER  NO PREVIOUS EXPERIMENT HAS SIMULTANEOUSLY DEFINED 1 THE SPATIAL CONTEXT OF THE DRIVING GRAVITY WAVE AND INSTABILITY DYNAMICS OVER EXTENDED HORIZONTAL SCALES  2 THE TRANSITION FROM LARGER SCALE INSTABILITIES TO TURBULENCE  AND 3 THE EVOLVING INSTABILITY AND TURBULENCE CHARACTER EXTENDING TO THE TURBULENCE INNER SCALE CONTINUOUSLY IN TIME THROUGHOUT THE EVENT.  SERENDIPITOUS IMAGING OF SMALL SCALE INSTABILITY AND TURBULENCE STRUCTURES IN POLAR MESOSPHERIC CLOUDS PMCS BY STAR CAMERAS SUPPORTING THE EBEX STRATOSPHERIC BALLOON EXPERIMENT HAS DEMONSTRATED THE POTENTIAL FOR SUCH OBSERVATIONS. THESE IMAGES REVEAL INSTABILITY AND TURBULENCE DYNAMICS EXTENDING FROM A FEW KM TO  10 20 M SCALES  PIXEL RESOLUTION OF 3 M  AND OFFER A NEW WINDOW ON THESE DYNAMICS THAT WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY POSSIBLE WITH ANY MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE. THE KEYS TO THIS SENSITIVITY LIE IN THE VERY THIN PMC LAYER BRIGHTNESS WHERE ADVECTION CAUSES STRONG PMC THINNING AND IMAGING FROM ABOVE ATMOSPHERIC TURBULENCE AT LOWER ALTITUDES.  OUR PROPOSED EXPERIMENT WOULD EXPAND PMC IMAGING CAPABILITIES SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY. NEW IMAGING USING VERY HIGH RESOLUTION  50 MPIXEL  DETECTORS AND CO ALIGNED WIDE AND NARROW FIELDS OF VIEW  FOV  WOULD EXTEND HORIZONTAL SPATIAL COVERAGE FROM  100 KM TO  10 M SCALES WITH IMAGING RESOLUTION AS HIGH AS 2 M. A FIXED ANTI SUN VIEWING PLATFORM WOULD ALLOW TRACKING OF ENTIRE EVENTS THROUGHOUT THEIR EVOLUTION EXTENDING MANY BUOYANCY PERIODS  AN HOUR OR LONGER  WITH 2 S RESOLUTION. HIGH RESOLUTION MODELING OF GRAVITY WAVE  INSTABILITY  AND TURBULENCE DYNAMICS THAT HAS ALREADY YIELDED TANTALIZING COMPARISONS OF SIMULATED AND OBSERVED DYNAMICS WOULD BE EMPLOYED TO GUIDE QUANTIFICATION OF THE OBSERVED EVENTS.  THE FLIGHT PROGRAM WOULD UTILIZE A SMALL OR MID SIZE CONSTANTPRESSURE BALLOON FLOWN FROM MCMURDO STATION  ANTARCTICA FOR A FLIGHT OF 1 2 WEEKS ALLOWING ONE ORBIT AROUND THE ANTARCTIC VORTEX IN AUSTRAL SUMMER. A LAUNCH WINDOW FROM 15 12 2017 TO 15 01 2018 WOULD GUARANTEE HIGH SENSITIVITY BY OUR IMAGERS TO THE MULTI SCALE DYNAMICS REVEALED IN PMC IMAGERY. THE EXPERIMENT WOULD LEVERAGE EBEX IMAGING HERITAGE  THE PROVEN CSBF SOLAR POWER AND COURSE POINTING SYSTEMS  AND ELECTRONICS AND SOFTWARE TO MINIMIZE RISK IN COST AND THE DEVELOPMENT TIMESCALE. THE ENTIRE PAYLOAD WOULD WEIGH  1000 LBS  FACILITATING A RELATIVELY SIMPLE AND COST EFFECTIVE LAUNCH. MINIMUM TELEMETRY WOULD BE NEEDED TO EVALUATE IMAGER PERFORMANCE DURING THE MISSION  WITH DATA STORED ONBOARD UNTIL RETRIEVAL OF THE PAYLOAD FOLLOWING THE MEASUREMENT PROGRAM. THE PAYLOAD WOULD BE DELIVERED TO THE NASA BALLOON FACILITY IN PALESTINE  TX FOR TESTING AND SHIPPING TO MCMURDO  4 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ANTICIPATED LAUNCH WINDOW. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WOULD HAVE SPECIFIC RELEVANCE TO GOALS 2 AND 4 IN THE RECENT HELIOPHYSICS DECADAL SURVEY  SOLAR AND SPACE PHYSICS  A SCIENCE FOR A TECHNOLOGICAL SOCIETY    DETERMINE THE DYNAMICS AND COUPLING OF EARTHS MAGNETOSPHERE  IONOSPHERE  AND ATMOSPHERE AND THEIR RESPONSE TO SOLAR AND TERRESTRIAL INPUTS    DISCOVER AND CHARACTERIZE FUNDAMENTAL PROCESSES THAT OCCUR BOTH WITHIN THE HELIOSPHERE AND THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE.","","2018","$611,338","$0","$611,338","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Virginia", "","","","",""

"BC SCIENTIFIC CONSULTING LLC","","United States","","","","","THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO EXTEND THREE LONG-TERM MICROWAVE MEASUREMENT PROJECTS WHICH HAVE BEEN MAKING NASA-SUPPORTED MIDDLE ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENTS OF OZONE  CHLORINE MONOXIDE  AND WATER VAPOR NEARLY CONTINUOUSLY AS PART OF THE NETWORK FOR ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION CHANGE (NDACC) SINCE THE EARLY 1990 S. THESE MEASUREMENTS CONSIST OF O3 AND H2O MEASUREMENTS FROM LAUDER  NEW ZEALAND; CLO MEASUREMENTS FROM MAUNA KEA  HAWAII; O3 AND H2O MEASUREMENTS FROM MAUNA LOA  HAWAII; CLO MEASUREMENTS FROM SCOTT BASE  ANTARCTICA; AND H2O MEASUREMENTS FROM TABLE MOUNTAIN  CALIFORNIA. THESE PROGRAMS ARE BEING COMBINED IN ORDER TO BEST PROVIDE LONG-TERM CONTINUITY AND SUPPORT OF THE INSTRUMENTS AND MEASUREMENTS. ALL THREE OF THESE SPECIES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE CLIMATE SYSTEM. OZONE MEASUREMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL TO MONITOR THE BEGINNING OF ITS RECOVERY  AND CLO MEASUREMENTS ARE NEEDED TO INTERPRET THIS PROCESS. WATER VAPOR IS THE RESERVOIR OF ODD HYDROGEN IN THE MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE  AND IS THEREFORE ALSO IMPORTANT TO OZONE CHEMISTRY. IT HAS ALSO BEEN SUGGESTED THAT VARIATIONS IN STRATOSPHERIC H2O HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON DECADAL-SCALE GLOBAL SURFACE CLIMATE CHANGE. THE MOST IMPORTANT GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO MAINTAIN STABLE MEASUREMENTS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE ACCURATE DETECTION OF LONG-TERM CHANGE. IN ORDER TO ENSURE CONTINUED STABLE OPERATION INSTRUMENTS NEED TO BE UPDATED SO THAT THEY CAN BE MAINTAINED WITH CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY. THE H2O INSTRUMENTS HAVE UNDERGONE SIGNIFICANT UPDATES  ESPECIALLY OVER THE LAST ~4 YEARS  AND WE HAVE SHOWN THAT  AT MAUNA LOA AND TABLE MOUNTAIN  IT IS POSSIBLE WITH THESE NEW INSTRUMENTS TO EXTEND THE ALTITUDE RANGE OVER WHICH STABLE MEASUREMENTS CAN BE MADE TO 26-80KM (FROM THE ORIGINAL 40-80KM). BETWEEN 2010 AND 2011 OBSERVATIONS AT TABLE MOUNTAIN SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN H2O AT 26KM  CONSISTENT WITH SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS. THE NEW H2O INSTRUMENTS SHOULD  OVER THE PERIOD OF THIS PROPOSAL  REQUIRE MINIMAL ATTENTION. THE O3 AND CLO INSTRUMENTS PRESENTLY REMAIN ESSENTIALLY AS-BUILT BY MILLITECH ~20 YEARS AGO  AND SEVERAL COMPONENTS NEED TO BE REPLACED. A NEW CLO RECEIVER HAS BEEN DESIGNED  COMPLETED  AND RECENTLY DEPLOYED ON THE CLO INSTRUMENT AT MAUNA KEA. A SECOND SUCH RECEIVER IS BEING BUILT AS PART OF A NEW  NRL FUNDED  CLO INSTRUMENT. THIS RECEIVER WILL BE COUPLED TO A REDESIGNED BACK END  AND THIS NEW INSTRUMENT WILL BE DEPLOYED AT MAUNA KEA ALONGSIDE THE EXISTING CLO INSTRUMENT. BECAUSE OF DIFFICULTIES WITH MAINTAINING AN INSTRUMENT AT MAUNA KEA WE WILL  IF OBSERVING CONDITIONS PROVE ADEQUATE  CONTINUE THIS LONG-TERM TIME SERIES FROM THE NEARBY MAUNA LOA SITE. IN ADDITION TO OUR WORK ON LONG-TERM VARIATIONS  WE WILL CONTINUE OUR ANALYSIS OF DIURNAL O3 VARIATIONS. UNDERSTANDING THESE VARIATIONS IS IMPORTANT FOR THE HOMOGENIZATION OF O3 RECORDS  SUCH AS THOSE FROM THE SBUV INSTRUMENTS  WHERE THE MEASUREMENTS ARE MADE AT VARIOUS TIMES OF DAY.","","2018","$696,718","$0","$696,718","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","New York", "","","","",""

"ATMOSPHERIC & SPACE TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH ASSOCIATES","","United States","","","","","THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED CUBESAT MISSION IS TO INVESTIGATE THE UNDERLYING CAUSES BEHIND THE APPEARANCE OF F-REGION PLASMA STRUCTURES AND THE EVOLUTION OF THESE STRUCTURES AFTER FORMATION. OUR APPROACH TO ADDRESS THIS COMPLEX CHALLENGE PLACES SENSORS THAT MEASURE KEY PLASMA PARAMETERS IN A CIRCULAR  LOW TO MIDDLE INCLINATION ORBIT NEAR 400 KM ALTITUDE TO STUDY THE CORRELATION BETWEEN CONVECTION ELECTRIC FIELD VARIATIONS AND PLASMA DENSITIES AT DIFFERENT LOCAL TIMES AND LONGITUDES. TO DO THIS  MEASUREMENTS OF ION-DRIFTS AND PLASMA DENSITIES WILL BE MADE BY A MINIATURE ION VELOCITY METER AND A MICRO PLANAR LANGMUIR PROBE. THESE INSTRUMENTS WILL FLY ON A 6U CUBESAT WITH PRECISE 3-AXIS ATTITUDE CONTROL AND BODY MOUNTED SOLAR PANELS. THE SORTIE CUBESAT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF ALREADY MATURED CUBESAT TECHNOLOGIES AND REQUIRES NO DEPLOYABLE MECHANISMS. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES SCIENCE QUESTIONS IN THE NASA HELIOPHYSICS ROADMAP (2009) INCLUDING (A) UNDERSTANDING THE GLOBAL AND LOCAL ELECTRODYNAMICS OF THE ITM SYSTEM IN RESPONSE TO GEOMAGNETIC DYNAMICS AND (B) DISCOVERING THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES IN THE IONOSPHERE-THERMOSPHERE SYSTEM THROUGH RECURRENT MEASUREMENTS OF IONOSPHERIC IRREGULARITIES AND THE BACKGROUND CONDITIONS IN WHICH THEY FORM. WE EXPECT THAT THE PROPOSED MISSION WILL ADVANCE THE CAPABILITY TO PREDICT THE APPEARANCE OF LOW-LATITUDE IONOSPHERIC IRREGULARITIES BY OBSERVING THE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS THAT LEAD TO THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND EXAMINING THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ANY PRE-EXISTING WAVE STRUCTURE AND THE SPECTRAL CONTENT OF THE IRREGULARITIES THAT APPEAR AFTER SUNSET.","","2018","$766,823","$0","$766,823","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Colorado", "","","","",""

"BALL AEROSPACE & TECHNOLOGIES CORP.","Ball Corp.","United States","","","","","THE RECOGNITION IN RECENT DECADES THAT ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS HAVE ANGULAR MOMENTUM (AM) IN THE FORM OF NOT ONLY POLARIZATION (OR SPIN AM) BUT ALSO ORBITAL (OAM) HAS RESULTED IN AN EXPLOSION OF THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES TO UNDERSTAND THE POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FIELDS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS. THE FIRST APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED IN ASTRONOMY (EXOPLANET VORTEX CORONAGRAPH)  PARTICLE MANIPULATION (OPTICAL TWEEZERS)  AND ENCODING INFORMATION ON LASERS (OPTICAL COMMUNICATION). OAM IS A PREVIOUSLY UNRECOGNIZED DEGREE OF FREEDOM FOR LIGHT THAT CAN BE READILY CONTROLLED  MANIPULATED  AND DETECTED IN LASER BEAMS CHARACTERIZED BY HELICAL WAVEFRONTS THAT ROTATE FORWARD LIKE A SCREW (VORTEX BEAMS). THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED EFFORT IS TO UTILIZE VORTEX BEAMS TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE INFORMATION THAT CAN BE OBTAINED FROM BACKSCATTER LIDARS. A LIDAR RECEIVER WILL BE DEVELOPED THAT INCORPORATES AN OPTICAL ANGULAR MOMENTUM MODE SORTER. THIS WILL PROVIDE IMPROVED DAYTIME PERFORMANCE BY THE SPATIAL COHERENCY FILTERING OF BACKGROUND LIGHT AND ALLOW SINGLE SCATTERING TO BE UNIQUELY DISTINGUISHED FROM MULTIPLE SCATTERING IN TURBID ENVIRONMENTS (DENSE CLOUDS  COASTAL WATERS). THE LATTER IS ANALOGOUS TO THE EXOPLANET CORONAGRAPH: THE LIDAR BEAM WILL BE DETECTED TO GREATER OPTICAL DEPTH INTO TURBID MEDIA BECAUSE THE BRIGHT HAZE OF MULTIPLE SCATTERING WILL BE ELIMINATED. THE EFFORT WILL GO ON TO DEMONSTRATE HOW EXAMPLES OF VORTEX BEAMS CAN BE CREATED THAT WILL INTERACT WITH THE ATMOSPHERE IN DIFFERENT WAYS  IMPROVING OVERALL LIDAR PERFORMANCE.

"BUBBLEOLOGY RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL  INC.","","United States","","","","","THE ARCTIC IS A REGION EXPERIENCING CLIMATE CHANGE AT THE SAME RATE AS THE REST OF THE PLANET  BUT WITH IMPACTS ON SEASONAL AIR TEMPERATURES  OCEAN ICE COVER  LAND TEMPERATURES  AND SNOW AND PERMAFROST THAT ARE ACCENTUATED RELATIVE TO THOSE OBSERVED IN OTHER PLACES. MANY OF THESE IMPACTS HAVE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CLIMATE FEEDBACKS REGIONALLY AND GLOBALLY. CHARACTERIZING ARCTIC CHANGES ONSYNOPTIC SCALES  GIVEN LOGISTICAL AND WEATHER CONSTRAINTS  REQUIRES SATELLITE DATA. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT ARCTIC OCEAN REGIONAL-SCALE CH4 IS CORRELATED NEGATIVELY WITH FRACTIONAL ICE COVER ON SEASONAL AND AN INTER-ANNUAL BASES. MOREOVER  THERE IS EVIDENCE FORM IASI THAT CH4 IS INCREASING  SUCH AS A COMPARISON BETWEEN CH4 MAPS FOR NOVEMBER IN 2008 AND 2012. OUR MAIN HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE ARCTIC OCEAN IS A REGIONAL CH4 SOURCE WITH SEA ICE COVER EITHER COMPLETELY OR PARTIALLY BLOCKS THESE FLUXES  IN AGREEMENT WITH GEOLOGIC EVIDENCE (SEVERINGHAUS&BROOK 1999) AND RECENT ARCTIC OCEAN DATA (SHAKHOVA 2010). INCREASED ICE-FREE ARCTIC CONDITIONS WILL RESULT IN RISING ARCTIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO GLOBAL CH4 BUDGETS EVEN WITHOUT SOURCE EMISSION STRENGTH GROWTH. TERRA AND AQUA INSTRUMENTS PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT DATA (SST  ALGAE  CDOM  ICE COVER) FOR TESTING THIS HYPOTHESIS WHEN COMBINED WITH CH4 ATMOSPHERIC COLUMN ABUNDANCES  DERIVED FROM IASI. THE IASI SPECTRAL RESOLUTION ALLOWS AN AVERAGING KERNEL TO DERIVE LOWER CH4 (600 MB) THAN THE COARSER SPECTRAL RESOLUTION AIRS DATA (400 MB). OCEAN COLOR MODIS DATA IS FUSED WITH VIIRS AND CRIS. IN THIS PROJECT WE WILL ASSEMBLE AND FUSE THE ARCTIC DATA SOURCES FOR CH4 (IASI AND AIRS) AND SEA ICE COVER (MODIS  MASIE-NH). WE DERIVE CLOUD MASKS FROM MODIS DATA USING A NEW APPROACH AND THE STANDARD CLOUD PRODUCT. THE BOUNDARY LAYER WILL BE DERIVED DIRECTLY FROM CALIPSO AEROSOL DATA  AND INDIRECTLY FROM MODIS AND AMSR-E SST AND CLOUD TOP TEMPERATURES TO DERIVE A LAPSE RATE. BOUNDARY LAYER INFORMATION (WHICH LARGELY CONFINES THE CH4 (SHAKHOVA) WILL IMPROVE CH4 RETRIEVALS FROM AIRS IASI THROUGH BETTER ADDRESSING THERMAL PROFILE CONTRAST EFFECTS.THIS STUDY ADDRESSES KEY SCIENCE QUESTIONS:1. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT SST POORLY CHARACTERIZES UPPER ARCTIC OCEAN WATER-COLUMN WARMING AND THAT PARAMETERS LIKE ALGAL OCEAN COLOR  SEA ICE PERSISTENCE  AND SEABED CH4 EMISSIONS ARE BETTER CORRELATED.2. HOW DOES THE MARINE ARCTIC CH4 CONTRIBUTION AND GROWTH COMPARE WITH TERRESTRIAL CH4 ARCTIC CONTRIBUTION AND GROWTH LEADING TO ACCELERATING AND REGIONALLY SIGNIFICANT ARCTIC WARMING?3. WHAT ARE THE TEMPORAL (SEASONAL AND INTER-ANNUAL) TRENDS OF THESE SOURCES AND EMISSIONS?4.

"DRS ADVANCED ISR  LLC","","United States","","","","","DRS TECHNOLOGIES TAKES PLEASURE IN PRESENTING THIS MULTI-BAND UNCOOLED RADIOMETER IMAGER (MURI) PROPOSAL FOR THE INSTRUMENT INCUBATOR PROGRAM (IIP) THAT WILL PROVIDE IMPROVED RADIOMETRIC IMAGING PERFORMANCE  SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE COST  COMPLEXITY  AND DEVELOPMENT TIME FOR FUTURE POLAR ORBITING EARTH OBSERVATION IMAGING RADIOMETER SENSORS. OUR PROPOSED SOLUTION LEVERAGES CONVENTIONAL  LOW COST UNCOOLED MICROBOLOMETERS WITH A COMPACT PIEZO DRIVEN BACKSCAN AND OUR PATENTED TCOMP ALGORITHMS FOR IMPROVED RADIOMETRIC ACCURACY AND STABILITY. OUR SOLUTION ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR CRYOGENIC COOLING  SOLVES THE PROBLEM OF IMAGE SMEAR ASSOCIATED WITH THE BOLOMETERS RELATIVELY LONG TIME CONSTANT  WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ENSURING LOW NEDT. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE DRS PROPOSED MURI PROGRAM IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT MODERN  LOW COST  LARGE AREA MICROBOLOMETER FPAS CAN BE UTILIZED TO PROVIDE NARROW BAND RADIOMETRICALLY ACCURATE IMAGING IN 8 LWIR BANDS FOR EARTH SCIENCE APPLICATIONS. THE POTENTIAL EARTH SCIENCE APPLICATIONS FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY ARE LAND SURFACE CLIMATOLOGY  MEASUREMENT OF SOIL MOISTURE CONTENT  MEASUREMENT OF ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS  VOLCANO MONITORING  HAZARD MONITORING  GEOLOGY AND SOILS. ON THE IIP PROGRAM  DRS PLANS TO DESIGN  BUILD  TEST AND DEMONSTRATE AN UNCOOLED MICROBOLOMETER BREADBOARD SENSOR HARDWARE FOR EARTH OBSERVATION. OUR SCIENCE PARTNER  ROCHESTER INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (RIT)  WILL SUPPORT THE AIRBORNE DATA COLLECTS  RADIOMETRIC DATA ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON TO LANDSAT 8 FOR A TRUTH REFERENCE AND THE SCIENCE IMPLEMENTATION ASPECT OF THE INSTRUMENT DATA COLLECTS. DRS/RIT WILL COLLECT AIRBORNE DATA FOR THREE PRIMARY APPLICATIONS IN 8 SPECTRAL BANDS. THE FIRST WILL ASSESS INITIAL DATA QUALITY AND CALIBRATION WITH KNOWN TARGETS DEPLOYED  THE SECOND WILL DEMONSTRATE SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTS AVAILABLE OVER VEGETATIVE AND URBAN ENVIRONMENTS  WHILE THE THIRD WILL DEMONSTRATE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF VOLCANO MONITORING. ONE KEY TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTION IS THE USE OF A PIEZO BACK-SCAN STAGE LOCATED AT THE IMAGE PLANE. THE PIEZO DRIVE VELOCITY WILL BE SET TO MATCH THE AIRCRAFT GROUND VELOCITY DURING IMAGE COLLECTION  SUCH THAT THE IMAGE SMEAR FROM THE BOLOMETER S LONG TIME CONSTANT IS ELIMINATED. THIS IS CRITICAL FOR THE USE OF A STANDARD MICROBOLOMETER ARRAY WHICH TYPICALLY HAS ~14MSEC TIME CONSTANT. ANOTHER KEY FEATURE IS THE REAL-TIME RADIOMETRIC CORRECTION THAT WILL OCCUR DURING FLIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE INSTRUMENT AND OPTICS TEMPERATURE CHANGES DURING OPERATION. THIS METHODOLOGY IS BEING UTILIZED BY DRS IN COMMERCIAL RADIOMETERS AND WILL BE IMPLEMENTED HERE TO ACCOUNT FOR INSTRUMENT/OPTICS TEMPERATURE CHANGES AND THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO RADIOMETRIC ERROR. THIS IS A DRAMATIC SHIFT FROM PRIOR RADIOMETERS BUILT FOR EARTH OBSERVATION IN THAT THOSE INSTRUMENTS TYPICALLY COOL THE OPTICS TO REDUCE RADIOMETRIC ERROR. WE ENVISION A SPACE INSTRUMENT USING 10 FPAS  WITH UP TO 12 SPECTRAL FILTERS TO COVER A GROUND SWATH WIDTH OF 310KM FROM A 705KM ALTITUDE ORBIT AND A 100M GSD. FOR THIS AIRBORNE DEMO WE PLAN TO UTILIZE 4 FPAS WITH 8 SPECTRAL BAND FILTERS TO DEMONSTRATE THE KEY TECHNOLOGY WITHIN THE MORE LIMITED IIP PROGRAM BUDGET. FOR AN AIRBORNE DEMO  USING 120MM EFL F/1 OPTICS AT 15 000FT ALTITUDE  WILL HAVE A 0.65M GSD WITH TWO PARALLEL SWATH WIDTHS OF 414KM SEPARATED BY A GAP OF 619M. WE WILL SHOW DIRECT APPLICABILITY TO A SPACE INSTRUMENT AND HOW IT IS EASILY SCALABLE USING A STAGGER BUTTED ARRAY APPROACH. MUCH OF THE SAME HARDWARE COULD BE UTILIZED ON A SPACE VERSION OF THIS INSTRUMENT. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE OF THIS IIP PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO BE 36 MONTHS. THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PROGRAM WILL INVOLVE THE DESIGN OF THE INSTRUMENT HARDWARE  THE SECOND YEAR WILL BE THE BUILD OF THE COMPONENTS INTEGRATION AND ASSEMBLY OF THE INSTRUMENT AND THE THIRD YEAR WILL BE LABORATORY TEST OF THE INSTRUMENT AND AIRBORNE FIELD TESTING. ENTRY LEVEL TRL FOR THIS INSTRUMENT IS 3; EXIT LEVEL TRL AT THE END OF YEAR 3 WILL BE 6.","","2018","$800,000","$0","$800,000","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Ohio", "","","","",""

"LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION","Lockheed Martin","United States","","","","","CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS (CMES) AND LARGE SOLAR FLARES PRODUCE THE STRONGEST SPACE WEATHER DISTURBANCES  AND ARE DRIVEN BY THE RELEASE OF STORED MAGNETIC ENERGY LOW IN THE SOLAR CORONA. SINCE THE BUILD UP OF CORONAL MAGNETIC ENERGY IS INDUCED BY MAGNETIC EVOLUTION AT THE PHOTOSPHERE  THE ABILITY TO USE OBSERVATIONS OF THE EVOLVING PHOTOSPHERIC MAGNETIC FIELD TO DRIVE A TIME-DEPENDENT MODEL OF THE CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD HAS LONG BEEN A GOAL OF BOTH NASA'S LIVING WITH A STAR (LWS) PROGRAM AND THE MULTI-AGENCY NATIONAL SPACE WEATHER PROGRAM (NSWP)  WITH THE AIMS OF BOTH UNDERSTANDING HOW CMES AND FLARES WORK AND PREDICTING SUCH EVENTS. HERE  WE --- A COLLABORATIVE TEAM FROM UC BERKELEY  STANFORD  AND LOCKHEED-MARTIN --- DEMONSTRATE PRECISELY THIS ABILITY  USING SEQUENCES OF VECTOR MAGNETOGRAMS AND DOPPLERGRAMS FROM THE HELIOSEISMIC AND MAGNETIC IMAGER (HMI) INSTRUMENT ABOARD THE LWS PROGRAM'S SOLAR DYNAMICS OBSERVATORY TO DRIVE A MAGNETOFRICTIONAL (MF) MODEL OF THE CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD IN AR 11158  WHICH PRODUCED AN X2.2 FLARE. DURING A THREE-DAY SIMULATION RUN  MAGNETIC ENERGY IN THE MODEL FIELD INCREASED STEADILY  AND THE MODEL FIELD ERUPTED AT A TIME IN THE DATA SEQUENCE COINCIDENT WITH THE ACTUAL FLARE. WE PROPOSE TO IMPLEMENT THIS MF MODEL IN SPHERICAL COORDINATES  TO ENABLE REAL-TIME  LONG-TERM MODELING OF THE NON-POTENTIAL CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD  BOTH GLOBALLY AND FOR ACTIVE REGION (ARS). THE MODEL'S EARTH-FACING HEMISPHERE WILL BE DRIVEN USING ELECTRIC FIELDS DERIVED FROM THE OBSERVED EVOLUTION OF PHOTOSPHERIC LINE-OF-SIGHT MAGNETIC FIELDS AND ELECTRIC CURRENTS. FAR-SIDE DATA INPUTS WILL BE FROM AN EXISTING FLUX TRANSPORT CODE  COMBINED WITH HMI FAR-SIDE OBSERVATIONS OF NEW ACTIVE REGIONS  WITH EMPIRICAL PARAMETRIZATIONS OF ORIENTATION AND FLUX. BECAUSE THIS MODEL INCLUDES LARGE-SCALE CORONAL ELECTRIC CURRENTS  IT IS A SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT OVER EXISTING REAL-TIME GLOBAL CORONAL MODELS  WHICH ASSUME POTENTIAL FIELDS. DATA PRODUCTS AVAILABLE FROM THE MODEL INCLUDE: 1) THE EVOLVING PHOTOSPHERIC ELECTRIC FIELD  POYNTING FLUX  AND HELICITY FLUX; 2) ESTIMATES OF CORONAL FREE ENERGY AND NON-POTENTIAL GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY; 3) INITIAL AND TIME-DEPENDENT BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR MHD MODELING OF ACTIVE REGIONS; AND 4) TIME-DEPENDENT BOUNDARY CONDITIONS AND FLUX TUBE EXPANSION FACTORS FOR MHD AND EMPIRICAL SOLAR WIND MODELS. UNSTABLE CONFIGURATIONS FOUND FROM MF MODELS WILL BE DYNAMICALLY EVOLVED WITH LOCAL AND GLOBAL MHD CODES. MODULES USED TO DERIVE SURFACE ELECTRIC FIELDS FROM MAGNETIC EVOLUTION WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE HMI DATA PIPELINE  AND DATA PRODUCTS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE JSOC AND DIRECTLY TO SPACE WEATHER FORECASTERS AND USERS.

"METAMAGNETICS INC.","","United States","","","","","THE NASA AEROSOL/CLOUD/ECOSYSTEMS (ACE) MISSION  RECOMMENDED BY THE NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCILS EARTH SCIENCE DECADAL SURVEY  WILL SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADVANCED INSTRUMENTS TO MEASURE CLOUD DROPLETS  ICE CRYSTALS  RAIN AND SNOW  AND OTHER HYDROMETEOR TYPES AND TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR DYNAMICS ARE INFLUENCED BY THE PRESENCE OF AEROSOLS. THESE INFLUENCES IMPACT THE EARTHS ECOSYSTEMS AND THE OCEANS STORAGE OF CARBON DIOXIDE. ACE AND OTHER NASA MISSIONS REQUIRE INNOVATIVE COMPONENT-LEVEL TECHNOLOGY THAT: (I) REDUCES RISK  COST  SIZE  VOLUME  MASS  AND DEVELOPMENT TIME OF EARTH OBSERVING INSTRUMENTS; AND (II) ENABLES NEW DATA ACQUISITION FOR ENHANCED OBSERVATION MEASUREMENTS. IN THE PROPOSED EFFORT METAMAGNETICS INC. IN COLLABORATION WITH A NASA PRIME CONTRACTOR ADDRESSES THESE REQUIREMENTS THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ULTRA-LIGHTWEIGHT  COMPACT  COST-EFFECTIVE  HIGH-PERFORMANCE  MAGNET-LESS CIRCULATOR FOR USE IN SENSORS AND COMMUNICATIONS PHASED ARRAYS. THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS IMPORTANT APPLICATIONS IN ACE AS WELL AS OTHER NASA MISSIONS. A CIRCULATOR PROVIDES DUPLEX CAPABILITY IN A PHASED ARRAY TRANSMIT/RECEIVE MODULE AND ISOLATES AMPLIFIERS FROM UNWANTED REFLECTIONS. CONVENTIONAL FERRITE CIRCULATORS OCCUPY A DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE VOLUME IN THE FRONT-END THE T/R MODULE BECAUSE OF THE LARGE PERMANENT MAGNET REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY MAGNETIC BIAS FIELD. THE MAIN INNOVATION OF THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY CONSISTS IN METAMAGNETICS PROPRIETARY SELF-BIASED CIRCULATOR SUBSTRATE THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE EXTERNAL BIASING AND ALLOWS 90% REDUCTION IN VOLUME AND WEIGHT OF THE DEVICE. OUR SELF-BIASED CIRCULATOR ELIMINATES THE PERMANENT MAGNET BY UTILIZING A CRYSTALLOGRAPHICALLY TEXTURED MATERIAL THAT POSSESSES HIGH REMNANT MAGNETIZATION AND LOW MICROWAVE LOSSES WHILE IMPROVING RELIABILITY AND SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY. IN A PREVIOUS PHASE I NASA SBIR CONTRACT METAMAGNETICS DEVELOPED A PROOF OF CONCEPT PROTOTYPE OF THE PROPOSED CIRCULATOR DEMONSTRATING TRL 4. OVER THE 36-MONTH PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED EFFORT WE WILL DEVELOP  FABRICATE  AND TEST SELF-BIASED CIRCULATORS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO MEET PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS SET FOR THE NASA AEROSOL/CLOUD/ECOSYSTEMS (ACE) MISSION AND WILL DELIVER MULTIPLE UNITS TO NASA PRIME CONTRACTOR THAT WILL PERFORM SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND SYSTEM TESTING. AT THE END OF THE PROPOSED EFFORT WE PREDICT TO REACH TRL 6. OUR TEAM OF HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS COMBINES METAMAGNETICS  INC. EXPERTISE IN ADVANCED FERRITE-BASED DEVELOPMENT FOR MILITARY SECURITY  SURVEILLANCE AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS  AND NASA PRIME CONTRACTOR SYSTEM ENGINEERING KNOW-HOW IN MICROWAVE RADAR SYSTEMS FOR GROUND-BASED  SPACE  AND AIRBORNE PLATFORMS. NASA PRIME CONTRACTOR IS ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE ACE PROGRAM AND IN VIEW OF METAMAGNETICS CIRCULATOR TECHNOLOGY HIGH POTENTIAL HAS ALREADY INVESTED $100 000 IN IN-KIND FUNDS TO EVALUATE METAMAGNETICS SELFBIASED MATERIALS AND CIRCULATOR COMPONENTS.","","2018","$897,010","$0","$897,010","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Massachusetts", "","","","",""

IN PARTICULAR  THIS HAS PUSHED THE DEVELOPMENT OF SENSOR WEB SOFTWARE TO COORDINATE THE DATA COLLECTION PROCESS.  WHAT IS NOT WELL-DEVELOPED IS THE LOCAL (OR FLIGHT) SOFTWARE FOR FAST CONTROL OF SYSTEMS WITH MANY DEGREES OF FREEDOM.  TWO EXAMPLES OF SUCH SYSTEMS ARE THE NEWLY DEVELOPED ELECTRONICALLY STEERABLE FLASH LIDAR (ESFL)  AND TIGHT FORMATION FLYING CONTROL OF FUTURE CUBESAT MISSIONS.  WE PROPOSE A LOCAL  MULTI-LAYERED CONTROL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE HIGHER LEVEL SOFTWARE LAYERS.  THE LOCAL CONTROL IS BASED UPON AN ARCHITECTURE KNOWN AS MODEL PREDICTIVE CONTROL (MPC).  MPC HAS FOUND USE IN MANY DIFFERENT COMPLEX SYSTEMS WHERE THE CONTROLLED SYSTEM IS CHARACTERIZED AS MULTIVARIABLE  WITH MULTIPLE CONSTRAINTS AND POSSIBLY NONLINEAR.  THESE INCLUDE ROBOTIC VISION SYSTEMS  CHEMICAL PROCESSING AND HAS BEEN PROPOSED FOR QUAD-ROTOR AND FORMATION FLYING SPACECRAFT.  MPC OPTIMIZES THE DATA COLLECTION AT EACH TIME STEP FROM HIGHER LEVEL CONSTRAINTS AND COMMANDS AND IS ENABLED BY THE INCREASED COMPUTATIONAL POWER NOW AVAILABLE IN FPGA IMPLEMENTATIONS.  WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP THE MPC ARCHITECTURE FOR ESFL AND USE MODELS TO VERIFY IT S CAPABILITY FROM SYNTHETIC SCENES AND FUSION WITH OTHER SENSORS.  ESFL HAS POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUALLY STEERABLE LASER BEAMLETS AND WHEN COMBINED WITH OTHER SENSOR POSES A LARGE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM WELL SUITED TO THE MPC APPROACH.

WORKING WITH NIST  THE RADIOMETERS WILL BE FULLY CALIBRATED AND CHARACTERIZED FOLLOWING EXISTING PROTOCOLS. THE INSTRUMENTS WILL BE INTEGRATED ONTO AUTONOMOUS PROFILING FLOATS FOR UNTENDED OPTICAL PROFILING OVER PERIODS OF 3+ YEARS IN THE OPEN OCEAN. LASTLY  FIELD EVALUATIONS AND VALIDATIONS ARE PLANNED NEAR THE TWO FIXED CALIBRATION SITES NEAR HAWAII AND IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA.

"MICHIGAN AEROSPACE CORPORATION","","United States","","","","","MICHIGAN AEROSPACE CORPORATION HAS ASSEMBLED A TEAM TO DEVELOP A MICRO FABRICATED OPTICAL SEISMOMETER  FROSTY BASED ON WHISPERING GALLERY MODE TECHNOLOGY. THE CONCEPT  ALREADY VERIFIED USING MESO-SCALE COMPONENTS  WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR THE DEMANDING CONDITIONS FOUND ON EUROPA AND OTHER PLANETARY BODIES OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM (AND BEYOND). FOR EUROPA IN PARTICULAR  THIS SENSOR WILL ALLOW SURFACE-BASED MEASUREMENTS OF ICE CRUST THICKNESS AND SEISMIC ACTIVITY. PLANETARY EXPLORATION PRESENTS CONSIDERABLE CHALLENGES TO THE HARDWARE. THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE ON EUROPA IS 90K (140K AT THE EQUATOR NEAR DARK MATERIAL DURING DAYTIME AND NEAR 50K AT THE POLES) AND RADIATION NEAR 540 REM PER DAY AS EUROPA ORBITS WITHIN JUPITER S RADIATION BELTS. THIS ALL-OPTICAL SEISMOMETER AFFORDS ADVANTAGES OVER CONVENTIONAL INSTRUMENTATION. THE PROPOSED SEISMOMETER WILL BE COMPACT AND WILL REQUIRE LOW POWER TO OPERATE. COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE SEISMOMETER AND THE ATTENDING ELECTRONICS WILL BE CONDUCTED USING OPTICAL FIBERS  THUS MITIGATING THE IMPACT OF HIGH RADIATION CHARACTERISTIC OF PLANETARY EXPLORATION. THE SILICON-BASED MONOLITHIC FABRICATION WILL ENSURE THAT THE INSTRUMENT IS ABLE TO WITHSTAND THE RIGOR OF SPACE TRAVEL. IN THE PROPOSED CONCEPT  OPTICAL WHISPERING GALLERY MODES (WGM)  ALSO KNOWN AS MORPHOLOGY DEPENDENT RESONANCES (MDR)  ARE USED TO MEASURE MINUTE VARIATIONS IN THE RESONANCES OF AN OPTICAL MICRO-RESONATOR AFFECTED BY THE MOTION OF A PROOF MASS. THESE RESONANCES AFFORD A VERY HIGH OPTICAL QUALITY FACTOR Q  GREATER THAN 10^6. DUE TO THE HIGH Q-FACTORS  THE LINEWIDTHS OF THESE RESONANCES CAN BE EXTREMELY NARROW  MAKING THEM HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO ANY CHANGE IN THE MORPHOLOGY (SHAPE  SIZE  INDEX OF REFRACTION) OF THE RESONATOR OR ITS IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS (PROOF MASS IN THIS CASE). THE MICRO-FABRICATION TECHNIQUES WILL ENTAIL SILICON PHOTOLITHOGRAPHY  E-BEAM LITHOGRAPHY AND DEEP REACTIVE ION ETCHING (DRIE) FOR PRECISE POSITIONING OF THE COMPONENTS. THE PROPOSED EFFORT WILL EXTEND OVER TWO YEARS. THE FIRST YEAR WILL ENTAIL THE FABRICATION AND TESTING OF THE OPTICAL RESONATOR  AND THE COMPLETION OF THE SEISMOMETER. THE SECOND YEAR WILL SEE THE FABRICATION AND TESTING OF THE SEISMOMETER. BECAUSE OF THE LOW SWAP  SUCH A SEISMOMETER WILL BE SUITABLE FOR NASA S ROBOTIC MISSIONS.","","2018","$999,970","$0","$999,970","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Michigan", "","","","",""

LOW SIZE  WEIGHT  AND POWER (SWAP) IS ACHIEVED THROUGH REDUCED APERTURE (RELATIVE EDGE RESPONSE IMPROVED WITH PRECISION SCAN PATTERN THAT ELIMINATES GROUND MOTION SMEAR)  COMBINED APERTURE (VISIBLE THROUGH THERMAL IR)  AND NEW  LOWER SWAP CALIBRATION SOURCE. THIS IS A STEP-STARE SCAN ARCHITECTURE RATHER THAN THE WHISK BROOM OR PUSH BROOM SCAN ARCHITECTURE OF PRIOR LANDSAT SENSORS. COMPATIBILITY WITH LAUNCH FROM AN ESPA RING ALSO REDUCES LAUNCH COSTS. REMI VALIDATION INCLUDES AIRBORNE FLIGHTS THAT WILL UNDER FLY LANDSAT 8 FOR DIRECT COMPARISON OF LEVEL 1B DATA AND HIGHER DATA PRODUCTS. AIRBORNE FLIGHTS WILL ALSO BE CONDUCTED OVER SITES WITH VALIDATED GROUND-BASED OBSERVATIONS AS A SECOND  INDEPENDENT CHECK OF PERFORMANCE.

TO REACH THESE GOALS  THIS THEORY/MODELING/ SIMULATION (TMS) EFFORT CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS: (1) STATE-OF-THE-ART 3D RADIATIVE MHD SIMULATIONS OF SOLAR ERUPTIONS - THESE MODELS WILL BE DRIVEN BY THE EMERGENCE AND SUBSEQUENT EVOLUTION OF MAGNETIC FLUX THAT EVENTUALLY FORMS ARS. THEY WILL COVER A REGION SPANNING FROM THE UPPER LAYERS OF THE CONVECTION ZONE TO THE OVERLYING ATMOSPHERE (INCLUDING THE CORONA) AND INCLUDE THE NECESSARY PHYSICS (E.G. TIME-DEPENDENT HYDROGEN IONIZATION  REALISTIC EQUATION OF STATE  NON-LTE RADIATIVE ENERGY EXCHANGE  FIELD-ALIGNED THERMAL CONDUCTION IN THE CORONA ETC).  (2) ADVANCED DIAGNOSTICS FROM FORWARD-MODELING OF ATMOSPHERIC OBSERVABLES   WE WILL DEVELOP TOOLS THAT PROVIDE DIAGNOSTICS FOR ALL REGIONS OF THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE  NAMELY THE PHOTOSPHERE  CHROMOSPHERE  TRANSITION REGION AND CORONA. THE TOOLS WILL PRODUCE SYNTHETIC IMAGES AND SPECTRA TO COMPARE WITH DATA FROM NASA'S SOLAR MISSIONS (E.G. IRIS  SDO  HINODE) AND GROUND-BASED OBSERVATORIES.  (3) VALIDATED DATA-DRIVEN MODELS OF ARS - WE WILL BENCHMARK MODELS OF AR MAGNETIC FIELDS BASED ON NON-LINEAR FORCE-FREE FIELD EXTRAPOLATION (NLFFF) AND MAGNETOFRICTION (MF) TECHNIQUES AGAINST REAL OBSERVATIONS AND RADIATIVE MHD SIMULATIONS. THESE TECHNIQUES WILL THEN BE USED TO MODEL THE EVOLUTION OF OBSERVED ARS. SYNTHETIC OBSERVABLES CALCULATED FROM THE MODELS WILL BE DIRECTLY COMPARED AGAINST OBSERVATIONS FROM THE PHOTOSPHERE TO CORONA.  (4) METRICS FOR THE ERUPTIVE POTENTIAL OF ARS - WE WILL COMBINE ELEMENTS (1)   (3) AND EVALUATE PHYSICS-MOTIVATED METRICS THAT PROBE THE ERUPTIVE POTENTIAL OF ARS. THESE INCLUDE METRICS DERIVED FROM PHOTOSPHERIC/CHROMOSPHERIC MAGNETOGRAMS AND FROM CORONAL/ TRANSITION REGION SPECTRA.","","2018","$1,116,638","$0","$1,116,638","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","California", "Maryland","USA","publicly traded","aerospace and military contracting","aerospace & military contracting"

"ADVANCED MAGNET LAB  INC.","","United States","","","","","THE NEXT GENERATIONS OF AIRCRAFTS WILL HAVE TO MEET STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF EMISSIONS  EFFICIENCY AND NOISE. WHILE HIGH BYPASS RATIO TURBOFANS BROUGHT SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS TO AIRCRAFT PROPULSION  THE FUTURE WILL REQUIRE THE USE OF A DIFFERENT PROPULSION TECHNOLOGY. TURBO-ELECTRIC PROPULSION SHOWS GREAT POTENTIAL TO ADDRESS ALL THE N+3 OBJECTIVES THROUGH THE USE OF ELECTRICALLY DRIVEN FANS ALLOWING FOR DISTRIBUTED PROPULSION. TURBOFANS ARE REPLACED IN THIS APPROACH BY DUCTED FANS DRIVEN BY HIGH POWER DENSITY ELECTRIC MOTORS. THE ELECTRICAL POWER IS GENERATED BY A GAS TURBINE COUPLED TO A HIGH SPEED  HIGHPOWER DENSITY GENERATOR. HOWEVER  THE TURBO-ELECTRIC PROPULSION CONCEPT RELIES ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ELECTRIC MACHINES WITH POWER DENSITIES (KW/M3) AND SPECIFIC POWER (KW/KG) FAR LARGER THAN THAT OF CONVENTIONAL ELECTRIC MACHINES. FULLY SUPERCONDUCTING ROTATING MACHINES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO MATCH THE REQUIREMENTS OF TURBO-ELECTRIC PROPULSION AND PRESENT ENABLING TECHNOLOGY FOR THIS APPLICATION. SUPERCONDUCTING MACHINES REQUIRE OPERATION AT CRYOGENIC TEMPERATURE THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED BY USING CLOSED-CYCLE CRYOCOOLERS OR LIQUID CRYOGEN FLOW SUCH AS LIQUID HYDROGEN (LH2) THAT COULD ALSO BE USED AS ENERGY CARRIER FOR PROPULSION. THE DEVELOPMENT OF TURBO-ELECTRIC PROPULSION FOR AIRCRAFTS REQUIRES ACCURATE SIZING OF SUPERCONDUCTING MACHINES AND PERFORMING THE PERTINENT TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMUM MATERIALS AND OPERATING TEMPERATURE. NASA IS CURRENTLY USING SIZING MODELS FOR SUPERCONDUCTING MACHINES DEVELOPED BY DR. AND HIS COLLEAGUES. THESE MODELS WERE DEVELOPED AS PART OF THE NASA URETI ON AEROPROPULSION POWER AND TECHNOLOGY (UAPT) AND AT THE ADVANCED MAGNET LAB (AML). THE EXISTING MODELS ARE BASED ON ANALYTICAL MODELING OF ELECTRIC MACHINES PUBLISHED BY MILLER AND HUGHES AND ESTIMATES OF THE MASS OF THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE MACHINES ASSUMING A GIVEN ACTIVE LENGTH. IMPORTANT AC LOSS CALCULATIONS IN THIS MODEL ARE BASED ON EXPERIMENTAL DATA AVAILABLE IN THE LITERATURE AC LOSSES IN SUPERCONDUCTING STATORS ARE VERY CHALLENGING TO ESTIMATE AS THE ROTATING FIELD FROM THE ROTOR IS PHASE SHIFTED RELATIVE TO THE PHASE CURRENT WHICH DEPENDS ON THE ANGULAR STATOR POSITION. FURTHERMORE  THE MAGNITUDE OF THE APPLIED FIELD IS NOT UNIFORMLY DISTRIBUTED  AND THE ARMATURE REACTION TENDS TO DEMAGNETIZE THE MACHINE IMPACTING THE AC LOSSES. WHILE THE OUTSTANDING POTENTIAL OF THE TURBO-ELECTRIC PROPULSION HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED THROUGH A FEW PROJECTS  HIGHER FIDELITY MODELS ARE NEEDED TO PERFORM A MORE ACCURATE ASSESSMENT AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL. AML PROPOSES TO DEVELOP THE NEXT GENERATION OF SIZING MODEL BASED ON A COMPLETE 3D ANALYSIS OF SUPERCONDUCTING MACHINES USING SEMI-ANALYTICAL METHODS TO CALCULATE THE MAGNETIC FLUX DENSITY DISTRIBUTION INCLUDING ALL COMPONENTS OF THE MACHINE. THE MODEL WILL INCLUDE ALL RELEVANT AREAS OF DESIGN INCLUDING ELECTROMAGNETICS  THERMODYNAMICS AND MECHANICS. BASED ON SEMI-ANALYTICAL METHODS  THE MODEL WILL ENABLE RAPID CALCULATIONS AS NEEDED FOR SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION. THE MODEL TO BE DEVELOPED WILL BE FULLY VALIDATED  FIRST NUMERICALLY USING FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS (FEA) AND FINALLY EXPERIMENTALLY USING A SUPERCONDUCTING MACHINE DEVELOPED AT AML. SOME ASPECTS OF FULLY SUPERCONDUCTING MACHINES INCLUDING THE AC LOSSES AND THE FAULT BEHAVIOR HAVE NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY STUDIED IN THE PAST TO BUILD RELIABLE MODELS. WE THEREFORE PROPOSE TO FOCUS THE EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION ON THOSE IMPORTANT ASPECTS:THE PROPOSED PHYSICS-BASED MODEL WILL ALLOW TO DESIGN AND OPTIMIZE AIRCRAFTS BASED ON TURBO-ELECTRIC PROPULSION  WHICH IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF MORE EFFICIENT AIRCRAFTS WITH REDUCED TOXIC EMISSIONS AND NOISE POLLUTION. SUCH AIRCRAFTS WOULD ALSO ALLOW TAKE-OFF AND LANDING DURING THE NIGHT IN CITIES AND WOULD DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE COST OF OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE.","","2018","$1,486,708","$0","$1,486,708","NASA Aeronautics Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.002","","Florida", "","","","",""

"APPLIED GEOSOLUTIONS LLC","","United States","","","","","PARTIES TO THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE (UNFCCC) HAVE BEEN REQUESTED TO ESTABLISH ROBUST AND TRANSPARENT NATIONAL FOREST MONITORING SYSTEMS (NFMS) THAT USE A COMBINATION OF REMOTE SENSING AND GROUND-BASED FOREST CARBON INVENTORY APPROACHES TO ESTIMATE ANTHROPOGENIC FOREST-RELATED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND REMOVALS  REDUCING UNCERTAINTIES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE. A COUNTRY S NFMS SHOULD ALSO BE USED FOR DATA COLLECTION TO INFORM THE ASSESSMENT OF NATIONAL OR SUBNATIONAL FOREST REFERENCE EMISSION LEVELS AND/OR FOREST REFERENCE LEVELS (RELS/RLS). IN THIS WAY  THE NFMS FORMS THE LINK BETWEEN HISTORICAL ASSESSMENTS AND CURRENT/FUTURE ASSESSMENTS  ENABLING CONSISTENCY IN THE DATA AND INFORMATION TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REDD + ACTIVITIES IN COUNTRIES. THE CREATION OF A RELIABLE  TRANSPARENT  AND COMPREHENSIVE NFMS IS CURRENTLY LIMITED BY A DEARTH OF RELEVANT DATA THAT ARE ACCURATE  LOW-COST  AND SPATIALLY RESOLVED AT SUBNATIONAL SCALES. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP  EVALUATE  AND VALIDATE SEVERAL CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF A NFMS IN KALIMANTAN  INDONESIA  FOCUSING ON THE USE OF LIDAR AND RADAR IMAGERY FOR IMPROVED CARBON STOCK AND FOREST DEGRADATION INFORMATION. OUR GOAL WILL BE TO EVALUATE SENSOR AND PLATFORM TRADEOFFS SYSTEMATICALLY AGAINST IN SITU INVESTMENTS  AS WELL AS PROVIDE DETAILED TRACKING AND CHARACTERIZATION OF UNCERTAINTY IN A COST-BENEFIT FRAMEWORK. KALIMANTAN IS AN IDEAL AREA TO EVALUATE THE USE OF REMOTE SENSING METHODS BECAUSE MEASURING FOREST CARBON STOCKS AND THEIR HUMAN CAUSED CHANGES WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF CERTAINTY IN AREAS OF DENSE TROPICAL FORESTS HAS PROVEN TO BE DIFFICULT. WHILE THE PROPOSED NFMS COMPONENTS WILL BE DEVELOPED AT THE SUBNATIONAL SCALE FOR KALIMANTAN  WE WILL TARGET THESE METHODS FOR APPLICABILITY ACROSS BROADER GEOGRAPHIES AND FOR IMPLEMENTATION AT VARIOUS SCALES. THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL ADVANCE THE STATE OF THE ART OF MEASURING  REPORTING  AND VERIFICATION (MRV) SYSTEM METHODOLOGIES IN WAYS THAT ARE BOTH TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL. FIRST  BECAUSE A PRIMARY FOCUS OF CARBON MONITORING SYSTEMS  ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES  IS ON COST-EFFECTIVENESS  OUR ANALYSIS OF OPTIMAL INPUTS OF INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS SATELLITE  AIRBORNE  AND IN SITU MEASUREMENTS WILL PROVIDE VALUABLE PRACTICAL INFORMATION THAT COUNTRIES CAN USE TO CONSIDER THE TRADEOFFS. SECOND  BECAUSE QUANTIFYING AND UNDERSTANDING UNCERTAINTY IS CRITICAL BOTH IN AN EARTH SCIENCE RESEARCH CONTEXT AND WITH REGARD TO PAYMENT FOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICES  OUR DEVELOPMENT OF REUSABLE METHODS FOR TRACKING AND EVALUATING UNCERTAINTY WITHIN A CARBON MONITORING SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR STAKEHOLDERS AND RESEARCHERS TO UNDERSTAND AND MINIMIZE ERRORS ACROSS MRV COMPONENTS. THIRD  BECAUSE CARBON MONITORING REQUIRES INTEGRATION OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES WITH MULTIDISCIPLINARY SCIENTIFIC METHODS FROM FORESTRY  ECOLOGY  SOIL SCIENCE  REMOTE SENSING AND BIOGEOCHEMISTRY  OUR TEAM'S EXPERTISE IS PARTICULARLY WELL-CONSTRUCTED TO ADDRESS THESE COMPLEX SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL ISSUES.","","2018","$1,559,207","$0","$1,559,207","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","New Hampshire", "","","","",""

THE LANDSAT PROGRAM HAS PROVIDED CRITICAL SENSING OF OUR EARTH FOR OVER 40 YEARS  DELIVERING ESSENTIAL PRODUCTS AND UNDERSTANDING OF CHANGING LAND USE TO SCIENTISTS AND USERS AROUND THE WORLD. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE CONTINUE AND EXTEND THESE MEASUREMENTS WITH A SYSTEM THAT IS AFFORDABLE AND RESILIENT FOR FUTURE EARTH IMAGING NEEDS. HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING (HSI) PROMISES ACCESS TO NEW LAND ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES AND DATA PRODUCTS THROUGH THE MEASUREMENT OF IMAGE SCENES AT HIGH SPECTRAL RESOLUTION WHILE MAINTAINING CRITICAL CONTINUITY WITH TRADITIONAL LANDSAT DATA PRODUCTS. THROUGH OUR WORK ON THE SUSTAINABLE LAND IMAGING (SLI) REDUCED INSTRUMENT ENVELOPE STUDY AND THE ESTO NOVEL CONCEPTS FOR SLI STUDY  NGAS HAS DEMONSTRATED A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF SLI MISSION  INSTRUMENT AND CALIBRATION REQUIREMENTS  AND WE HAVE SHOWN THAT A VERSATILE HSI INSTRUMENT CAN MEET SLI INSTRUMENT GOALS. TO ADVANCE PHOTONIC IMAGING TECHNOLOGY  NGAS HAS DEVELOPED PROOF-OF-CONCEPT WAVEGUIDE FILTERS AND DETECTORS IN THE SHORTWAVE INFRARED (SWIR) RANGE ON IR&D. UNDER THE BLACK DIAMOND PROGRAM WE ARE IMPLEMENTING FIRST LEVEL INTEGRATION TECHNOLOGY FOR MATING THE WAVEGUIDE FILTERS WITH PHOTODETECTORS. WE WILL LEVERAGE THESE DEVELOPMENTS TO BUILD A PROTOTYPE SLI-T INSTRUMENT THAT REPRESENTS A REVOLUTIONARY STEP FOR LAND IMAGING. OUR OBJECTIVES FOR THE SLI-T ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATIONS PROGRAM ARE TO BUILD AND TEST A NEXT-GENERATION  HETEROGENEOUSLY INTEGRATED PHOTONIC INSTRUMENT COVERING TWO SLI BANDS 9 (1.36 1.39 M  3NM RESOLUTION) AND 6 (1.56   1.66 M  6NM RESOLUTION). TO MAXIMALLY USE EXISTING DESIGNS FOR RAPID PROGRESS  WE ARE EXECUTING THE PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT ON SWIR WAVELENGTHS. THE PHOTONIC/ELECTRONIC DESIGN  MANUFACTURE  INTEGRATION  AND TEST PROCESSES DEVELOPED FOR THE SWIR ARE DIRECTLY SCALABLE TO THE 0.4 1.0 M VISIBLE NEAR-INFRARED WAVELENGTH RANGE. THE BENEFITS OF USING LITHOGRAPHICALLY PATTERNED PHOTONIC WAVEGUIDE TECHNOLOGY ARE A TOTAL INSTRUMENT MASS AND VOLUME REDUCTION OF ~7X AND ~25X RESPECTIVELY COMPARED TO THE CURRENT MSI APPROACH. IT ENABLES IMAGE ACQUISITION IN SPECTRAL BANDS AND MODES NOT POSSIBLE WITH CURRENT LAND IMAGING INSTRUMENTS BRINGING NEW LAND PRODUCTS TO USERS FROM AN EXTREMELY COMPACT  SCALABLE INSTRUMENT.","","2018","$1,743,050","$0","$1,743,050","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","California", "Virginia","USA","publicly traded","aerospace and military contracting","aerospace & military contracting"

"DRS ADVANCED ISR  LLC","","United States","","","","","DRS TECHNOLOGIES TAKES PLEASURE IN PRESENTING THIS MULTI-BAND UNCOOLED RADIOMETER IMAGER (MURI) PROPOSAL FOR THE INSTRUMENT INCUBATOR PROGRAM (IIP) THAT WILL PROVIDE IMPROVED RADIOMETRIC IMAGING PERFORMANCE  SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE COST  COMPLEXITY  AND DEVELOPMENT TIME FOR FUTURE POLAR ORBITING EARTH OBSERVATION IMAGING RADIOMETER SENSORS. OUR PROPOSED SOLUTION LEVERAGES CONVENTIONAL  LOW COST UNCOOLED MICROBOLOMETERS WITH A COMPACT PIEZO DRIVEN BACKSCAN AND OUR PATENTED TCOMP ALGORITHMS FOR IMPROVED RADIOMETRIC ACCURACY AND STABILITY. OUR SOLUTION ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR CRYOGENIC COOLING  SOLVES THE PROBLEM OF IMAGE SMEAR ASSOCIATED WITH THE BOLOMETERS RELATIVELY LONG TIME CONSTANT  WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ENSURING LOW NEDT. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE DRS PROPOSED MURI PROGRAM IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT MODERN  LOW COST  LARGE AREA MICROBOLOMETER FPAS CAN BE UTILIZED TO PROVIDE NARROW BAND RADIOMETRICALLY ACCURATE IMAGING IN 8 LWIR BANDS FOR EARTH SCIENCE APPLICATIONS. THE POTENTIAL EARTH SCIENCE APPLICATIONS FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY ARE LAND SURFACE CLIMATOLOGY  MEASUREMENT OF SOIL MOISTURE CONTENT  MEASUREMENT OF ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS  VOLCANO MONITORING  HAZARD MONITORING  GEOLOGY AND SOILS. ON THE IIP PROGRAM  DRS PLANS TO DESIGN  BUILD  TEST AND DEMONSTRATE AN UNCOOLED MICROBOLOMETER BREADBOARD SENSOR HARDWARE FOR EARTH OBSERVATION. OUR SCIENCE PARTNER  ROCHESTER INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (RIT)  WILL SUPPORT THE AIRBORNE DATA COLLECTS  RADIOMETRIC DATA ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON TO LANDSAT 8 FOR A  TRUTH REFERENCE  AND THE SCIENCE IMPLEMENTATION ASPECT OF THE INSTRUMENT DATA COLLECTS. DRS/RIT WILL COLLECT AIRBORNE DATA FOR THREE PRIMARY APPLICATIONS IN 8 SPECTRAL BANDS. THE FIRST WILL ASSESS INITIAL DATA QUALITY AND CALIBRATION WITH KNOWN TARGETS DEPLOYED  THE SECOND WILL DEMONSTRATE SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTS AVAILABLE OVER VEGETATIVE AND URBAN ENVIRONMENTS  WHILE THE THIRD WILL DEMONSTRATE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF VOLCANO MONITORING. ONE KEY TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTION IS THE USE OF A PIEZO BACK-SCAN STAGE LOCATED AT THE IMAGE PLANE. THE PIEZO DRIVE VELOCITY WILL BE SET TO MATCH THE AIRCRAFT GROUND VELOCITY DURING IMAGE COLLECTION  SUCH THAT THE IMAGE SMEAR FROM THE BOLOMETER S LONG TIME CONSTANT IS ELIMINATED. THIS IS CRITICAL FOR THE USE OF A STANDARD MICROBOLOMETER ARRAY WHICH TYPICALLY HAS ~14MSEC TIME CONSTANT. ANOTHER KEY FEATURE IS THE REAL-TIME RADIOMETRIC CORRECTION THAT WILL OCCUR DURING FLIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE INSTRUMENT AND OPTICS TEMPERATURE CHANGES DURING OPERATION. THIS METHODOLOGY IS BEING UTILIZED BY DRS IN COMMERCIAL RADIOMETERS AND WILL BE IMPLEMENTED HERE TO ACCOUNT FOR INSTRUMENT/OPTICS TEMPERATURE CHANGES AND THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO RADIOMETRIC ERROR. THIS IS A DRAMATIC SHIFT FROM PRIOR RADIOMETERS BUILT FOR EARTH OBSERVATION IN THAT THOSE INSTRUMENTS TYPICALLY COOL THE OPTICS TO REDUCE RADIOMETRIC ERROR. WE ENVISION A SPACE INSTRUMENT USING 10 FPAS  WITH UP TO 12 SPECTRAL FILTERS TO COVER A GROUND SWATH WIDTH OF 310KM FROM A 705KM ALTITUDE ORBIT AND A 100M GSD. FOR THIS AIRBORNE DEMO WE PLAN TO UTILIZE 4 FPAS WITH 8 SPECTRAL BAND FILTERS TO DEMONSTRATE THE KEY TECHNOLOGY WITHIN THE MORE LIMITED IIP PROGRAM BUDGET. FOR AN AIRBORNE DEMO  USING 120MM EFL F/1 OPTICS AT 15 000FT ALTITUDE  WILL HAVE A 0.65M GSD WITH TWO PARALLEL SWATH WIDTHS OF 414KM SEPARATED BY A GAP OF 619M. WE WILL SHOW DIRECT APPLICABILITY TO A SPACE INSTRUMENT AND HOW IT IS EASILY SCALABLE USING A STAGGER BUTTED ARRAY APPROACH. MUCH OF THE SAME HARDWARE COULD BE UTILIZED ON A SPACE VERSION OF THIS INSTRUMENT. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE OF THIS IIP PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO BE 36 MONTHS. THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PROGRAM WILL INVOLVE THE DESIGN OF THE INSTRUMENT HARDWARE  THE SECOND YEAR WILL BE THE BUILD OF THE COMPONENTS INTEGRATION AND ASSEMBLY OF THE INSTRUMENT AND THE THIRD YEAR WILL BE LABORATORY TEST OF THE INSTRUMENT AND AIRBORNE FIELD TESTING. ENTRY LEVEL TRL FOR THIS INSTRUMENT IS 3; EXIT LEVEL TRL AT THE END OF YEAR 3 WILL BE 6.","","2018","$1,951,752","$0","$1,951,752","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Ohio", "","","","",""

ACHIEVING THESE GOALS WILL ENABLE THE COST-EFFECTIVE CONSTRUCTION OF LIGHT-WEIGHT  HIGHLY-NESTED X-RAY TELESCOPES HAVING GREATER OBSERVATIONAL SENSITIVITY  WIDER ENERGY COVERAGE  AND HIGHER ANGULAR RESOLUTION THAN CAN BE ACHIEVED AT PRESENT. THE REALIZATION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL THUS BENEFIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A VARIETY OF EXPLORER-CLASS NASA X-RAY ASTRONOMY MISSIONS NOW BEING FORMULATED FOR BOTH THE SOFT AND HARD X-RAY BANDS  AND WILL ENABLE THE CONSTRUCTION OF FUTURE FACILITY-CLASS X-RAY MISSIONS THAT WILL REQUIRE BOTH HIGH SENSITIVITY AND HIGH RESOLUTION. BUILDING ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR PREVIOUS APRA-FUNDED RESEARCH  WE PLAN TO INVESTIGATE NEW THIN-FILM GROWTH TECHNIQUES  NEW MATERIALS  AND NEW APERIODIC COATING DESIGNS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP NEW HARD X-RAY MULTILAYERS THAT HAVE HIGHER X-RAY REFLECTANCE  WIDER ENERGY RESPONSE  LOWER FILM STRESS  AND GOOD STABILITY  AND THAT CAN BE PRODUCED MORE QUICKLY  AT REDUCED COST. ADDITIONALLY  WE PROPOSE TO BUILD UPON OUR EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN SUB-NM FILM-THICKNESS CONTROL USING VELOCITY MODULATION AND MASKED DEPOSITION TECHNIQUES  AND IN THE RECENT DEVELOPMENT OF LOW-ROUGHNESS  LOW-STRESS FILMS GROWN BY REACTIVE SPUTTERING  IN ORDER TO DEVELOP NEW METHODS FOR CORRECTING MID-FREQUENCY SURFACE ERRORS IN THIN-SHELL MIRROR SUBSTRATES USING BOTH DIFFERENTIAL DEPOSITION AND ION-BEAM FIGURING  EITHER ALONE OR IN COMBINATION. THESE TWO SURFACE-CORRECTION TECHNIQUES ALREADY BEING USED FOR SUB-NM FIGURING OF PRECISION OPTICS IN A VARIETY OF DISCIPLINES  INCLUDING DIFFRACTION-LIMITED EUV LITHOGRAPHY AND SYNCHROTRON APPLICATIONS REQUIRING SUB-MICRON FOCUSING   ARE IDEALLY SUITED FOR CONTROLLING MM-SCALE SURFACE ERRORS IN THE THIN-SHELL SUBSTRATES USED FOR ASTRONOMICAL X-RAY TELESCOPES. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE HIGH-THROUGHPUT PROCESSING USING THESE TECHNIQUES  WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A NOVEL APPROACH USING AN ELECTRONICALLY-ACTUATED APERTURE MECHANISM TO ACTIVELY CONTROL THE SHAPE OF A LONG  RECTANGULAR MM-SCALE BEAM OF ADATOM OR IONS AS THE SUBSTRATE MOVES PAST AT CONSTANT VELOCITY  THEREBY ENABLING EFFICIENT  TWO-DIMENSIONAL FIGURE CORRECTION OF MULTIPLE SHELLS SIMULTANEOUSLY.","","2018","$2,287,289","$0","$2,287,289","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","New York", "","","","",""

"BALL AEROSPACE & TECHNOLOGIES CORP.","Ball Corp.","United States","","","","","THE ATHENA OAWL AEROSOL TRANSPORT  HURRICANES  AND EXTRA TROPICAL NUMERICAL WEATHER PREDICTION USING OPTICAL AUTO COVARIANCE WIND LIDAR MISSION CONCEPT WAS PROPOSED TO THE EARTH VENTURE INSTRUMENT ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY IN LATE 2013. REVIEWS WERE STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF THE PROPOSED SCIENCE  BUT INDICATED THAT ADDITIONAL AIRBORNE OAWL INSTRUMENT DEMONSTRATION AND VALIDATION WERE REQUIRED. UNDER THE ATHENA OAWL VENTURE TECH AOVT EFFORT  THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AND BALL AEROSPACE WILL BUILD  FLY  AND VALIDATE A 532 NM GREEN  ROBUST AIRBORNE VERSION OF OAWL TO SERVE AS AN AIRBORNE DEMONSTRATOR FOR THE ATHENA OAWL MISSION CONCEPT. THE PROPOSED GREEN OAWL GROAWL INSTRUMENT WILL OPERATE AT THE SINGLE 532 NM WAVELENGTH AND WILL BE THE FIRST AIRBORNE SYSTEM TO DEMONSTRATE A TWO LOOK TWO TELESCOPE  TWO LASER APPROACH TO MEASURING VECTOR WINDS AS RECOMMENDED BY SCIENTISTS WORKING IN NUMERICAL WEATHER PREDICTION. THE AOVT TEAM WILL BUILD AND PREPARE THIS SYSTEM FOR AUTONOMOUS FLIGHT TESTS ON THE HIGH ALTITUDE NASA WB57 AIRCRAFT  PERFORM A SET OF TEST FLIGHTS  AND THEN ANALYZE AND COMPARE THE FLIGHT DATA TO RADIO SONDE DATA TO VALIDATE THE PERFORMANCE ACCURACY AND PRECISION OF GROAWL WIND MEASUREMENTS. ADDITIONAL SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF THE FLIGHT DATA WILL INCLUDE STUDIES OF THE FREQUENCY AND IMPACT OF CLOUD RETURNS  AND PRESENCE OF 532 NM AEROSOL BACKSCATTER AT THE SUB AIRCRAFT ALTITUDES. UNDER THE AOVT EFFORT  AN OPTION TO ADVANCE TRL OF KEY COMPONENTS IN THE SYSTEM WILL INCLUDE LASER LIFETIME TESTING AT 532 NM  INTERFEROMETER ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING  AND JOINT LASER AND INTERFEROMETER SYSTEM TESTING. THE AOVT WILL BE A 24 MONTH EFFORT AND WILL BRING THE GROAWL SYSTEM FROM TRL 3 TO AIRCRAFT TRL6. IF THE OPTIONS ARE EXERCISED  SOME OF THE COMPONENTS WILL BE BROUGHT TO SPACE TRL6.","","2018","$5,937,182","$0","$5,937,182","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Colorado", "Colorado","USA","publicly traded","paper and packaging","packaging"

ROUTINE SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS OF THE CHROMOSPHERIC MAGNETIC FIELD WILL ALLOW OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHROMOSPHERE AND ITS CONNECTION TO THE REST OF THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE TO IMPROVE DRAMATICALLY. BEFORE SUCH A SATELLITE CAN BE CONSIDERED FOR FLIGHT  IT IS IMPORTANT TO REFINE THE MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES BY EXPLORING CANDIDATE EMISSION LINES WITH A RANGE OF MAGNETIC SENSITIVITIES. IN SEPTEMBER 2015  CLASP ACHIEVED THE FIRST MEASUREMENT OF THE LINEAR POLARIZATION PRODUCED BY SCATTERING PROCESSES IN A FAR UV RESONANCE LINE (HYDROGEN LYMAN-ALPHA)  AND THE FIRST EXPLORATION OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD VIA THE HANLE EFFECT IN QUIET REGIONS OF THE CHROMOSPHERE-CORONA TRANSITION REGION. THESE MEASUREMENTS ARE A VITAL FIRST STEP TOWARDS ROUTINE QUANTITATIVE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE LOCAL THERMAL AND MAGNETIC CONDITIONS IN THIS KEY LAYER OF THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE. NONETHELESS  LYMAN-ALPHA IS ONLY ONE OF THE MAGNETICALLY SENSITIVE SPECTRAL LINES IN THE UV SPECTRUM; THE MG II H AND K SPECTRAL LINES NEAR 280 NM  WHOSE CORES FORM ABOUT 100 KM BELOW THE LYMAN-ALPHA CORE  ARE ALSO A COMPELLING TARGET. THIS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE SENSITIVE TO A LARGER RANGE OF FIELD STRENGTHS THAN LYMAN-ALPHA  THROUGH BOTH THE HANLE AND ZEEMAN EFFECTS. STUDYING THE POLARIZATION OF THE MG II RESONANCE LINES IS ALSO PARTICULARLY TIMELY SINCE THEIR INTENSITY SPECTRUM HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WITH IRIS AND VIA ADVANCED NUMERICAL MODELS.

THE MATERIAL COULD BE USED DRY  WET  FROZEN WITH WATER OR AS PART OF A SELF-PRODUCED COMPOSITE WHICH COULD ALLOW SUCH ENHANCEMENTS AS RADIATION PROTECTION AND A VAPOR SEAL. IT IS SELF-REPLICATING SO THE HABITAT COULD BE EXTENDED AT A FUTURE DATE  AND SELF-REPAIRING. SOME FORM OF THIS MATERIAL COULD BE USED FOR A HABITAT AT DESTINATION  ADDITIONAL BUILDINGS  THE SHELL OF MULTIPLE ROVERS AND FURNITURE. THE FIBROUS MATERIAL IS FUNGAL MYCELIUM  THE VEGETATIVE STRUCTURE OF FUNGI CONSISTING OF BRANCHING  THREAD-LIKE HYPHAE. MYCELIAL MATERIALS  ALREADY COMMERCIALLY PRODUCED  ARE KNOWN INSULATORS  FIRE RETARDANT  AND DO NOT PRODUCE TOXIC GASSES. METRICS FOR THESE MATERIALS SHOW COMPRESSION STRENGTHS SUPERIOR TO DIMENSIONAL LUMBER  FLEXURAL STRENGTH SUPERIOR TO REINFORCED CONCRETE  AND COMPETITIVE INSULATION VALUES. AS MYCELIA NORMALLY EXCRETE ENZYMES  IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO BIOENGINEER THEM TO SECRETE OTHER MATERIALS ON DEMAND SUCH AS BIOPLASTICS OR LATEX TO FORM A BIOCOMPOSITE. MYCELIA ARE MORE FLEXIBLE AND DUCTILE THAN REGOLITH ALONE. AS A STANDALONE MATERIAL OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH AGGLUTINATED OR SINTERED REGOLITH  A MYCOTECTURAL BUILDING ENVELOPE COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE ENERGY REQUIRED FOR BUILDING BECAUSE IN THE PRESENCE OF FOOD STOCK AND WATER IT WOULD GROW ITSELF. AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF HUMANS  ADDITIONAL STRUCTURES COULD BE GROWN WITH FEEDSTOCK OF MISSION-PRODUCED ORGANIC WASTE STREAMS. MELANIN-RICH FUNGI HAVE THE ABILITY TO ABSORB RADIOACTIVITY SUGGESTING THAT MELANIZED FUNGAL MYCELIA COULD PROVIDE RADIATION PROTECTION. LEAD FOUND IN THE REGOLITH  OR OTHER RADIATION BLOCKING MATERIALS SUCH AS WATER COULD ACCUMULATE IN THE MYCELIA PROVIDING ADDITIONAL RADIATION PROTECTION. WHEN PROTECTED  THE MYCOMATERIALS CAN HAVE A LONG LIFE  BUT AT THE END OF ITS LIFE CYCLE THE MATERIAL COULD BE BECOME FERTILIZER FOR MISSION FARMING. OUR CONCEPT FITS WITHIN THE MARS DRA 5.0 'COMMUTER' SCENARIO  WITH THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BEING THAT THE HABITATS AND THE SHELLS OF THE ROVERS WOULD BE BUILT AT DESTINATION. ON EARTH  A FLEXIBLE PLASTIC SHELL PRODUCED TO THE FINAL HABITAT DIMENSIONS WOULD BE SEEDED WITH MYCELIA AND DRIED FEEDSTOCK AND THE OUTSIDE STERILIZED. AT DESTINATION  THE SHELL COULD BE CONFIGURED TO ITS FINAL INNER DIMENSIONS WITH STRUTS. THE MYCELIAL AND FEEDSTOCK MATERIAL WOULD BE MOISTENED WITH MARTIAN OR TERRESTRIAL WATER DEPENDING ON MASS TRADE-OFFS  AND HEATED  INITIATING FUNGAL (AND LIVING FEEDSTOCK) GROWTH. MYCELIAL GROWTH WILL CEASE WHEN FEEDSTOCK IS CONSUMED  HEAT WITHDRAWN OR THE MYCELIA HEAT-KILLED. IF ADDITIONS OR REPAIRS TO THE STRUCTURES ARE NEEDED  WATER  HEAT AND FEEDSTOCK CAN BE ADDED TO REACTIVATE GROWTH OF THE DORMANT FUNGI. THE PROPOSED WORK FOCUSES ON FILLING SELECT KEY TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE GAPS SUCH AS THE TEMPERATURE RANGE OF MYCELIAL GROWTH  RADIATION PROTECTION  POTENTIAL FOR ALGAL FEEDSTOCK AND ENMESHED BIOSENSORS  MASS OF INPUTS AND FINISHED PRODUCT  AND MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF THE MATERIALS. THE POTENTIAL FOR ENHANCING STRUCTURAL AND SENSING CAPABILITIES BY THE INCORPORATION OF THE BACTERIUM BACILLUS SUBTILUS  IS NOVEL. ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN CONCEPTS BASED ON THIS VISION WILL BE EXAMINED FOR USE IN A MISSION CONTEXT INCLUDING MASS TRADE-OFFS  AND TEMPERATURE INPUTS  AS WELL AS SUGGESTING NEW TERRESTRIAL ROUTES TO INFUSION WHERE RAPIDLY BUILT  LIGHTWEIGHT STRUCTURES ARE DESIRED. IF SUCCESSFUL IN DEVELOPING A BIOCOMPOSITE MATERIAL THAT CAN GROW ITSELF  NASA WILL HAVE A RADICALLY NEW  CHEAPER  FASTER LIGHTER MATERIAL FOR DESIGNING HABITATS FOR EXTENDED DURATION LUNAR MISSIONS  MARS MISSIONS  AND MOBILE HABITATS AS WELL AS FURNITURE AND OTHER STRUCTURES.","","2018","$30,000","$0","$30,000","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","California", "","","","",""

UNDERSTANDING THE DRIVERS CONTROLLING THE SPATIAL SCALES OF WAVE ACTIVITY IN THE INNER MAGNETOSPHERE IS CRITICAL FOR UNCOVERING THE UNDERLYING PHYSICS BEHIND THE WAVE GENERATION AS WELL AS FOR BETTER PREDICTION OF WHERE AND WHEN WAVES WILL BE PRESENT. RECENT STUDIES OF EMIC WAVES REVEAL A DEPENDENCE OF THE WAVE SPATIAL EXTENT ON MAGNETIC LOCAL TIME (MLT)  WAVE FREQUENCY  AND L SHELL. VARIOUS HYPOTHESES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO EXPLAIN SOME OF THESE PATTERNS  INCLUDING DIFFERENT SOURCES (AND SPATIAL EXTENTS) OF ION ANISOTROPY ON THE DAY VERSUS NIGHT SIDE  COMPOSITIONAL VARIATIONS THROUGHOUT THE INNER MAGNETOSPHERE  OR COLD PLASMA DENSITY STRUCTURE.

"SCIENCE SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS  INC.","SAIC","United States","","","","","THE CONTRIBUTION OF ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOLS TO THE EARTH S ENERGY BUDGET IS AN IMPORTANT  YET RELATIVELY UNCERTAIN  COMPONENT OF THE EARTH SYSTEM. STRATOSPHERIC AEROSOLS REPRESENT A LESS WELL-STUDIED  BUT NEVERTHELESS SIGNIFICANT  ELEMENT OF THIS CONTRIBUTION THROUGH THEIR IMPACT ON DIRECT RADIATIVE FORCING OF THE CLIMATE SYSTEM. COMPREHENSIVE MEASUREMENTS OF AEROSOL EXTINCTION VERTICAL PROFILES WITH DENSE SPATIAL SAMPLING ARE NEEDED TO BETTER CONSTRAIN CLIMATE MODEL SIMULATIONS OF AEROSOL EXTINCTION  COMPOSITION  AND PARTICLE SIZE  IN ORDER TO COMPUTE CLIMATE IMPACTS. THE MOST EFFECTIVE SOURCE OF STRATOSPHERIC AEROSOL EXTINCTION DATA COMES FROM SATELLITE LIMB SCATTERING MEASUREMENTS  WHICH PROVIDE GREATER SENSITIVITY THAN SPACE-BASED LIDAR AND MUCH BETTER SPATIAL SAMPLING THAN OCCULTATION MEASUREMENTS. THE OZONE MAPPING AND PROFILING SUITE (OMPS) LIMB PROFILER (LP)  CURRENTLY FLYING ON THE SUOMI NATIONAL POLARORBITING PARTNERSHIP (S-NPP) SATELLITE  HAS BEEN PROVIDING DAILY AEROSOL EXTINCTION PROFILE DATA FROM LIMB SCATTERING MEASUREMENTS SINCE APRIL 2012. WHILE THE S-NPP OMPS LP INSTRUMENT WAS DESIGNED FOR A 7-YEAR OPERATING LIFETIME  THE NEXT OMPS LP INSTRUMENT IS NOT SCHEDULED TO FLY UNTIL 2022. THIS RAISES THE POSSIBILITY OF A DATA GAP IN THIS CRUCIAL MEASUREMENT. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT  CALLED GLOBAL AEROSOL MONITORING SYSTEM (GAMS)  TO SUPPLEMENT THE OMPS LP MEASUREMENTS. OUR DESIGN USES MULTIPLE VIEWING DIRECTIONS TO IMPROVE SPATIAL SAMPLING AND PROVIDE MORE BALANCED MEASUREMENT SENSITIVITY THROUGHOUT THE ORBIT COMPARED TO OMPS LP. WAVELENGTH SELECTION IN THIS DESIGN IS LIMITED TO SIMPLE FILTERS (675 NM FOR AEROSOL SCIENCE  350 NM FOR ALTITUDE REGISTRATION) TO ENABLE A COMPACT INSTRUMENT SUITABLE FOR CUBESAT DEPLOYMENT.

RECENT RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT LARGE-AMPLITUDE GRAVITY WAVES GENERATED BY CONVECTION ARE IMPORTANT DRIVERS OF CIRCULATION  TEMPERATURES  AND TRANSPORT IN THE LOWER STRATOSPHERE  WHICH INFLUENCE ATMOSPHERIC CONSTITUENTS SUCH AS OZONE AND WATER VAPOR. HOWEVER MOST ATMOSPHERIC MODELS HAVE BIASES IN TEMPERATURES AND WINDS BECAUSE OF DEFICIENCIES IN THE WAY THAT GRAVITY WAVES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON CIRCULATION ARE REPRESENTED. THIS PROBLEM IS ESPECIALLY PRONOUNCED IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE STRATOSPHERE  WHERE WINDS ARE GENERALLY TOO STRONG AND TEMPERATURES TOO COLD IN MOST CHEMISTRY-CLIMATE MODELS. ADDITIONALLY  THE STRATOSPHERIC FINAL WARMING IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE IS TYPICALLY ONE OR TWO WEEKS LATE IN MODELS COMPARED TO OBSERVATIONS. THIS LEADS TO MAJOR TEMPERATURE BIASES IN THE LOWER STRATOSPHERE AND ASSOCIATED EFFECTS ON OZONE CHEMISTRY. THE REASONS FOR THESE BIASES ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD  ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT MISSING SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE GRAVITY WAVE DRAG IN MODELS IS A MAJOR CULPRIT. POSSIBLE SOURCES OF THE MISSING GRAVITY WAVE DRAG INCLUDE INADEQUATE CONTINENTAL OROGRAPHIC GRAVITY WAVE DRAG  OROGRAPHIC GRAVITY WAVE DRAG FROM SMALL  UNRESOLVED ISLANDS  LATERAL PROPAGATION OF GRAVITY WAVES GENERATED AT OTHER LATITUDES  AND NONOROGRAPHIC GRAVITY WAVES GENERATED BY FRONTS AND CONVECTION. DEFICIENCIES IN MODELED GRAVITY WAVE EFFECTS AND THE RESULTING MODEL BIASES IN WIND AND TEMPERATURE IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE HINDER OUR ABILITY TO ACCURATELY MODEL THE OZONE HOLE AND ITS RECOVERY  WHICH ALSO HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR ABILITY TO MODEL SURFACE CLIMATE CHANGE. THIS PROJECT WILL IDENTIFY THE IMPORTANT SOURCES OF THE MISSING GRAVITY WAVE DRAG IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE AND IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF GRAVITY WAVE SOURCES AND GRAVITY WAVE IMPACTS ON CIRCULATION  TRANSPORT  AND COMPOSITION. THE METHODS WILL FOCUS ON DATA FROM NASA SATELLITE INSTRUMENTS  INCLUDING PRECIPITATION AND LATENT HEATING FROM THE GLOBAL PRECIPITATION MEASUREMENT (GPM) MISSION  INFRARED BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURES FROM THE ATMOSPHERIC INFRARED SOUNDER (AIRS)  AND TEMPERATURES FROM THE HIGH RESOLUTION DYNAMICS LIMB SOUNDER (HIRDLS). FOR EXAMPLE  AT THE EXTREMES OF THE HIRDLS MEASUREMENT LATITUDES (NEAR 63 DEGREES IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE)  THE ZONAL SAMPLING IS VERY DENSE AND PROVIDES AN ABUNDANCE OF INFORMATION ON WAVES SPANNING MANY SPATIAL SCALES. THIS INFORMATION HAS NOT YET BEEN EXPLOITED TO INVESTIGATE THE MISSING SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE DRAG. THE GRAVITY WAVE INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE SATELLITE INSTRUMENTS WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE THE SOURCES OF MISSING DRAG IN THE CCMI MODELS. THIS WILL RESULT IN RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVED GRAVITY WAVE PARAMETERIZATIONS  WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO SIMULATE THE OZONE HOLE AND ITS RECOVERY IN A CHANGING CLIMATE.","","2018","$89,951","$0","$89,951","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Washington", "","","","",""

"LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION","Lockheed Martin","United States","","","","","SCIENCE MOTIVATION: CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS (CME) HAVE BEEN EXPLORED AND QUANTIFIED WITH THE TRADITIONAL WHITE-LIGHT THOMSON SCATTERING METHOD ON ONE HAND  AND WITH THE NOVEL EUV DIMMING ANALYSIS ON THE OTHER HAND. THE EUV DIMMING METHOD IS SENSITIVE TO THE EVOLUTION OF THE CORONAL FLARE PLASMA IN THE LOWEST DENSITY SCALE HEIGHT OF THE CORONA  WHILE THE WHITE-LIGHT METHOD PROBES THE POLARIZED BRIGHTNESS AT HELIOSPHERIC DISTANCES (BEYOND A FEW SOLAR RADII OCCULTED BY THE CORONAGRAPHS). BOTH METHODS COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER AND BOTH METHODS HAVE THEIR OWN (LARGELY) UNKNOWN SYSTEMATIC ERRORS  WHICH CAN ONLY BE OVERCOME WHEN MODELING OF BOTH METHODS YIELD MUTUALLY CONSISTENT PHYSICAL PARAMETERS. DATA ANALYSIS METHOD: A NOVEL EUV DIMMING ANALYSIS METHOD HAS RECENTLY BEEN REFINED ALONG THE FOLLOWING LINES: (1) DIFFERENTIAL EMISSION MEASURE ANALYSIS THAT YIELDS FLARE AND CME TEMPERATURES AND ELECTRON DENSITIES; (2) THE CME GEOMETRY IN TERMS OF A 3D SPHERE UNDERGOING SELF-SIMILAR ADIABATIC EXPANSION; (2) THE INCLUSION OF SOLAR GRAVITATIONAL DECELERATION DURING THE ACCELERATION AND PROPAGATION OF THE CME  WHICH DISCRIMINATES ERUPTIVE AND CONFINED CMES; (4) A SELF-CONSISTENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CME CENTER-OF-MASS MOTION DETECTED DURING EUV DIMMING AND THE LEADING-EDGE MOTION OBSERVED IN WHITE-LIGHT CORONAGRAPHS; (5) THE EQUI-PARTITION OF THE CME KINETIC AND THERMAL ENERGY; AND (6) THE ROSNER-TUCKER-VAIANA (RTV) SCALING LAW APPLIED TO THE TEMPORARY EQUILIBRIUM OF HEATING AND COOLING RATES DURING THE FLARE PEAK TIME. THE REFINED CME MODEL IS ENTIRELY BASED ON EUV DIMMING OBSERVATIONS (USING AIA/SDO DATA) AND COMPLEMENTS THE TRADITIONAL WHITE-LIGHT SCATTERING MODEL (USING LASCO/SOHO DATA)  AND BOTH MODELS ARE INDEPENDENTLY CAPABLE TO DETERMINE FUNDAMENTAL CME PARAMETERS SUCH AS THE CME MASS  SPEED  AND ENERGY. SPECIFIC SCIENCE GOALS: A MAJOR GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONSISTENCY AND THE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS OF BOTH THE WHITE-LIGHT SCATTERING AND EUV DIMMING METHODS. WE ENVISION THAT THE DATA ANALYSIS METHOD CAN BE FURTHER REFINED SO THAT BOTH METHODS YIELD CONSISTENT PHYSICAL PARAMETERS  IN PARTICULAR THE SPATIO-TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF THE CME VOLUME  MASS  SPEED  AND ENERGY. SINGLE CASE STUDIES WITH BOTH METHODS SHOULD REVEAL WHICH OBSERVABLES ARE MOST SUITABLE AND HOW RELIABLE PHYSICAL PARAMETERS CAN BE INFERRED. ULTIMATELY  ONE METHOD SHOULD BE ABLE TO SERVE AS PROXI FOR THE OTHER METHOD  SO THAT WE CAN WE CAN USE THE TWO METHODS INTERCHANGABLY AND CAN QUANTIFY ERRORS. RELIABLE PHYSICAL MODELS OF THE CME SOURCE ALLOW US TO PREDICT THE CME DYNAMICS ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THEY ENTER THE CORONAGRAPH FIELD-OF-VIEW. MISSION DATA: THE PLANNED STUDY WILL INCLUDE OVER 1000 FLARE-ASSOCIATED CME EVENTS OF GOES C  M  AND X-CLASS DURING THE ENTIRE (8 YEAR) MISSION OF THE SOLAR DYNAMICS OBSERVATORY (SDO). WE PRIMARILY ANALYZE AIA/SDO  LASCO/SOHO  AND COR-2/STEREO DATA AND WILL USE CME CATALOGS FROM LASCO/CDAW  CACTUS  SEEDS  CORIMP  AND COR-2/STEREO.

"SOLANA SCIENTIFIC INC","","United States","","","","","WE PROPOSE A THREE-YEAR RESEARCH PROGRAM TO INVESTIGATE THE FORMATION MECHANISMS  PROPERTIES  AND GLOBAL IMPACTS OF FORESHOCK BUBBLES (FBS). OUR ELECTROMAGNETIC HYBRID (KINETIC IONS  FLUID ELECTRONS) SIMULATIONS WERE THE FIRST TO PREDICT THE EXISTENCE OF FBS. THEY SHOWED THAT THE INTERACTION OF SOLAR WIND ROTATIONAL DISCONTINUITIES (RDS) WITH BACKSTREAMING IONS IN THE FORESHOCK RESULTS IN THE FORMATION OF FBS WITH DIMENSIONS COMPARABLE TO THE WIDTH OF THE FORESHOCK (~10 RE). THE SAME SIMULATIONS PREDICT THAT THE SOLAR WIND CONVECTS FBS INTO THE BOW SHOCK  INITIATING CHANGES THAT EXTEND FROM THE MAGNETOSHEATH TO MAGNETOSPHERE AND DOWN TO THE IONOSPHERE. SINCE THEN  MULTIPOINT OBSERVATIONS HAVE CONFIRMED THE EXISTENCE OF FBS AND THEIR GLOBAL EFFECTS IN THE SOLAR WIND  MAGNETOSHEATH  INNER MAGNETOSPHERE  AND IN THE IONOSPHERE. OBSERVATIONS DEMONSTRATE THAT NOT ONLY RDS BUT ALSO SOLAR WIND TANGENTIAL DISCONTINUITIES (TDS) CAN CREATE FBS. SPACECRAFT OBSERVATIONS HAVE ALSO ESTABLISHED THAT FBS HAVE FAR GREATER EFFECTS UPON THE MAGNETOSPHERE AND IONOSPHERE THAN ANY OTHER FEATURE GENERATED BY KINETIC PROCESSES WITHIN THE FORESHOCK. BOTH SIMULATIONS AND OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT FORESHOCK BUBBLES ARE HIGHLY EFFICIENT PARTICLE ACCELERATORS. UPON ENCOUNTERING THE BOW SHOCK  THE HIGH FLUXES OF ENERGETIC IONS WITHIN THEIR CORE REGIONS ARE INJECTED INTO THE MAGNETOSHEATH AND POSSIBLY INTO THE MAGNETOSPHERE. ALTHOUGH WE KNOW THAT FBS FORM WHEN SOLAR WIND RDS AND TDS INTERACT WITH THE BACKSTREAMING IONS IN THE FORESHOCK  WE DO NOT KNOW THE CONDITIONS DETERMINING WHICH RDS OR TDS FORM FORESHOCK BUBBLES. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED STUDY ARE TO (1) DETERMINE WHICH SOLAR WIND DISCONTINUITIES CAN FORM FORESHOCK BUBBLES; (2) DETERMINE THE PHYSICAL PROCESSES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HIGHLY EFFICIENT PARTICLE ACCELERATION WITHIN FBS; (3) DETERMINE THE PROPERTIES OF FBS IN THE MAGNETOSHEATH AND THEIR IMPACTS UPON THE MAGNETOSPHERE AS A FUNCTION OF SOLAR WIND CONDITIONS  ESPECIALLY THE (CONE) ANGLE BETWEEN THE INTERPLANETARY MAGNETIC FIELD (IMF) AND SOLAR WIND VELOCITY. DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF THIS INVESTIGATION  WE WILL CONDUCT A SERIES OF HYBRID SIMULATIONS TO ADDRESS HOW RDS AND TDS FORM FORESHOCK BUBBLES FOR DIFFERENT SOLAR WIND CONDITIONS. WE WILL COMPARE SIMULATION PREDICTIONS TO FB OBSERVATIONS TO ESTABLISH THAT THE TWO ARE IN AGREEMENT. IN THIS REGARD  WE NOTE THAT SPACECRAFT OBSERVATIONS HAVE ALREADY ESTABLISHED THE NEED FOR MODELING AND THEORETICAL EFFORTS TO ADDRESS HOW TDS IN ADDITION TO RDS CAN BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FORMATION OF FBS GIVEN THE ABSENCE OF A MAGNETIC FIELD COMPONENT NORMAL TO TDS. DURING THE SECOND YEAR  WE WILL USE HYBRID SIMULATIONS TO DETERMINE THE NATURE OF PARTICLE ACCELERATION MECHANISMS WITHIN FBS  SUCH AS 1ST AND 2ND ORDER FERMI PROCESSES. WE WILL ALSO COMPARE THE PREDICTED FLUXES  ENERGIES AND VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS OF THE ENERGETIC IONS WITH SPACECRAFT OBSERVATIONS. DURING THE THIRD YEAR  WE WILL EXAMINE HOW THE SHAPE AND IMPACTS OF FBS WITH THE MAGNETOSPHERE CHANGE WITH THE IMF CONE ANGLE. FOR EXAMPLE  WE EXPECT FBS TO FORM UPSTREAM OF THE DAYSIDE MAGNETOPAUSE FOR SMALL IMF CONE ANGLES  BUT UPSTREAM OF THE FLANK OR HIGH LATITUDE BOW SHOCK FOR LARGE IMF CONE ANGLES. THE FORMER EVENTS WOULD IMPACT THE SUBSOLAR MAGNETOPAUSE  WHEREAS THE LATTER WOULD STRIKE THE MAGNETOTAIL OR HIGH LATITUDE MAGNETOPAUSE. THE PROPOSING TEAM CONSISTS OF DRS. N. OMIDI (PI)  D. SIBECK (CO-I) AND A POSTDOC AT GSFC. THE PROPOSING TEAM HAS PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN PREDICTING AND THE SPACECRAFT DISCOVERY OF FORESHOCK BUBBLES  AND HAS THE IDEAL EXPERTISE AND TOOLS TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY.","","2018","$142,427","$0","$142,427","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","California", "","","","",""

"AEOLIS RESEARCH  INC.","","United States","","","","","THE INSIGHT MISSION WILL RETURN CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF WINDS  PRESSURE  AND AIR AND GROUND TEMPERATURE OVER MULTIPLE SEASONS  MAKING IT OF HUGE INTEREST TO THOSE WORKING ON MARS WEATHER  AS WELL AS ON RELATED FIELDS SUCH AS DUST DEVILS AND AEOLIAN PROCESSES. THE INVESTIGATION PROPOSED HERE WILL GAIN INSIGHT BY DIRECT ANALYSIS OF THE DATASET  COMPARISON WITH NUMERICAL MODELING (BY MESOSCALE AND LARGE EDDY SIMULATION) OF THE LANDING SITE ATMOSPHERE  AND COMPARISON WITH MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY (MSL) ATMOSPHERIC DATA. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF WEATHER  DUST DEVIL ACTIVITY  AND AEOLIAN PROCESSES ON MARS VIA THE ANALYSIS OF INSIGHT MEASUREMENTS AND THEIR COMPARISON WITH ATMOSPHERIC MODEL PREDICTIONS. THIS GOAL IS ADDRESSED THROUGH FOUR  INTERRELATED INVESTIGATIONS: 1. DETERMINE THE CONTROLS ON THE DIURNAL AND SEASONAL PRESSURE CYCLE. HAVING ATMOSPHERIC DATA AT TWO LOCATIONS (MSL AND INSIGHT) IS VERY VALUABLE. MSL IS AT A SIMILAR LONGITUDE AND ONLY 9DEG AWAY IN LATITUDE  BUT WITH VERY DIFFERENT LOCAL TOPOGRAPHY AND IN THE OPPOSITE HEMISPHERE  HENCE REGULAR MSL PRESSURE MONITORING MAY BE COMBINED WITH CONTINUOUS INSIGHT MONITORING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF DIFFERENT CIRCULATION COMPONENTS (FROM THE CO2 CYCLE AND HADLEY CELL TO TIDES AND TRAVELING WAVES TO CRATER TOPOGRAPHY) TO THE SEASONAL AND DIURNAL PRESSURE CYCLES. 2. UNDERSTAND REGIONAL FLOWS NEAR THE DICHOTOMY BOUNDARY. ALTHOUGH MSL'S WIND SENSOR IS NO LONGER IN USE  THE SEASONAL RECORD OF WINDS IN GALE WILL BE COMPARED WITH INSIGHT WINDS TO BUILD A BETTER PICTURE OF THE REGIONAL FLOW IN THIS AREA. COMPARISON WITH MODELS WILL BE USED TO ASSESS THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE HADLEY OVERTURNING CIRCULATION  DICHOTOMY BOUNDARY SLOPE FLOWS  TIDAL FLOWS  ETC. TO THE PATTERN OF WINDS IN THIS REGION. 3. UNDERSTAND VORTEX ACTIVITY. SHORT  DEEP PRESSURE DROPS WILL BE USED TO INDICATE CONVECTIVE VORTEX PASSAGE. THEIR DEPENDENCE ON TIME OF DAY AND SEASON ARE IMPORTANT FOR CONSTRAINING OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE BOUNDARY LAYER WHERE THEY FORM AND ALSO VITAL TO UNDERSTAND A MAJOR MECHANISM OF DUST LIFTING. AN IN SITU DATASET OF BOTH VORTICES AND THE ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS IN WHICH THEY FORMED  AT ONE LOCATION OVER MULTIPLE SEASONS  WILL BE INVALUABLE BOTH FOR UNDERSTANDING THEIR DEPENDENCE ON ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS AND FOR VALIDATING MODELS AND THEORIES OF VORTEX PRODUCTION AND DUST DEVIL-BASED DUST LIFTING. BOTH MESOSCALE AND LES MODELING WILL BE USED TO PREDICT VORTEX ACTIVITY  WITH A COMPARISON WITH OBSERVATIONS USED TO INDICATE DEFICIENCIES IN THE MODELS OR THEORY. 4. MONITOR AEOLIAN ACTIVITY AND INFER THRESHOLDS FOR PARTICLE MOTION. WIND DATA WILL BE COMPARED WITH A) TEMPORAL CHANGES IN AEOLIAN FEATURES AND B) CHANGES IN SURFACE SOIL  DECK  OR SOLAR PANEL DUST COVER BETWEEN TWO IMAGES  IN ORDER TO INFER PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT  SUCH AS THE THRESHOLD FOR SALTATION. AEOLIAN FEATURE CHARACTERISTICS WILL ALSO BE PREDICTED USING WIND DATA AND MODEL OUTPUT AND COMPARED WITH OBSERVATIONS TO ASSESS AEOLIAN THEORY AND MODEL PERFORMANCE. THE PI HAS SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE IN WORKING ON SUCH INVESTIGATIONS AS A MEMBER OF THE MSL SCIENCE TEAM [E.G. BRIDGES ET AL.  2017]. THE PI WILL PARTICIPATE STRONGLY IN THE ATMOSPHERE THEME GROUP  AS SHE DOES IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL THEME GROUP ON MSL  AND ALSO IN THE GEOLOGY THEME GROUP  TO E.G.

OUR APPROACH WILL BE TWOFOLD  ON ONE END INCORPORATING NEW TECHNIQUES IN MODELING THE GLOBAL SOLAR CORONA AND SOLAR WIND  AND ON THE OTHER USING THE LATEST OBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS TO BENCHMARK  IMPROVE  AND POSSIBLY RULE OUT MECHANISMS AND FORMULATIONS. ALTHOUGH THIS IS A VAST AREA OF STUDY  WE FOCUS ON TWO KEY SCIENCE QUESTIONS SPECIFICALLY SELECTED TO SPAN A LARGE DYNAMIC RANGE OF SCALE AND SCIENTIFIC INTEREST FROM THE CORONA TO ONE AU  NAMELY: 1) IS THE RELATIVELY STEADY HEATING AND ACCELERATION THAT WE EXPECT FROM WAVE TURBULENCE SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN THE RELATIVE CHARGE-STATE AND SPEED STRATIFICATION OF THE FAST AND SLOW SOLAR WIND? 2) CAN THE HEATING AND ACCELERATION FROM WAVE TURBULENCE ACCOUNT FOR THE PLASMA STRUCTURING AND NON-THERMAL WIDTHS MEASURED IN POLAR CORONAL HOLES? TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS  THE CENTRAL THEME OF OUR RESEARCH PLAN WILL BE CONDUCTING FOCUSED  REALISTIC EXPERIMENTS USING A MULTIDIMENSIONAL THERMODYNAMIC MHD MODEL OF THE SOLAR CORONA AND SOLAR WIND. WE WILL INTERPRET OUR RESULTS IN THE DIRECT CONTEXT OF OBSERVATIONS AND FORWARD-MODELED OBSERVABLES. OUR HEATING AND ACCELERATION MODEL WILL BE BASED ON A WAVE-TURBULENCE-DRIVEN (WTD) FORMULATION THAT CAPTURES THE MACROSCOPIC PROPAGATION  REFLECTION  AND DISSIPATION OF LOW FREQUENCY ALFVENIC TURBULENCE. PART OF THE RESEARCH PLAN WILL FOCUS ON TESTING AND BENCHMARKING APPROXIMATIONS FOR THE HEATING AND REFLECTION TERMS IN THE PRESENCE OF MAGNETIC INTERFACE REGIONS  SUCH AS CORONAL STREAMERS AND THE FAST AND SLOW WIND INTERFACE. MOST IMPORTANTLY  OUR RESEARCH PLAN EMPHASIZES CAREFUL OBSERVATIONAL SYNTHESIS AND MODEL COMPARISON---EXAMINING NOT ONLY FULLSUN EUV IMAGES  BUT ALSO EMISSION LINES AND LINE-WIDTHS AT VARIOUS REGIONS IN THE CORONA  AND CHARGE STATES IN THE SOLAR WIND. WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS BY LEVERAGING A NEW CAPABILITY IN OUR MODEL  ONE THAT ALLOWS US TO TRACK THE TIME-DEPENDENT  NON-EQUILIBRIUM IONIZATION STATE OF MINOR IONS AT ALL SPATIAL LOCATIONS IN THE MODEL. THIS WILL ENABLE US TO VASTLY IMPROVE OUR CALCULATIONS OF SYNTHETIC OBSERVABLES ALL THE WAY FROM THE LOW CORONA (SOHO/EIT  STEREO/EUVI  SDO/AIA  AND HINODE/EIS)  TO THE EXTENDED CORONA (SOHO/UVCS)  TO 1AU (ACE/WIND AND ULYSSES). THIS PROJECT IS ALSO TIMELY AND RELEVANT TO THE GOALS OF NASA AND THE HELIOPHYSICS DECADAL SURVEY. OUR EFFORT BRINGS TOGETHER RECENT ADVANCES IN GLOBAL CORONAL MODELING AND VETS THEM USING A WEALTH OF INFORMATION GLEANED FROM NASA MISSIONS AND INSTRUMENTS. BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN NUMERICAL MODELS AND REMOTE SENSING DIAGNOSTICS HAS BECOME CRUCIAL FOR INTERPRETING THE COMPLEXITY OF MODERN OBSERVATIONS  AND THIS SITUATION WILL CONTINUE WITH THE UPCOMING PARKER SOLAR PROBE AND SOLAR ORBITER MISSIONS. THIS CONTEXT IS SPECIFICALLY RELEVANT FOR THE SCIENCE OF POLAR CORONAL HOLES AND THE SLOW AND FAST PROPERTIES OF THE SOLAR WIND  WHICH WE STUDY HERE. TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS WE HAVE FORMED A TEAM WITH A BROAD RANGE OF EXPERTISE FROM ANALYTICAL THEORY  TO NUMERICAL MODELS  TO OBSERVATIONAL ANALYSIS---A MAKEUP REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CURRENT SCOPE AND GOALS OF THE HELIOPHYSICS SUPPORTING RESEARCH PROGRAM.","","2018","$155,504","$0","$155,504","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","California", "","","","",""

"ATMOSPHERIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH  INC.","","United States","","","","","AMMONIA (NH3) IS THE MAJOR BASE IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND COMPRISES A LARGE FRACTION OF ATMOSPHERIC REACTIVE NITROGEN. NH3 CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO PARTICULATE MATTER (PM) THROUGH THE FORMATION OF AMMONIUM SALTS  CONTRIBUTING TO CARDIOVASCULAR AND RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES WORLDWIDE. NH3 ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO NITROGEN DEPOSITION; FLOW OF EXCESS NITROGEN IS ONE OF THE LARGEST THREATS TO BIOSPHERE INTEGRITY. AGRICULTURE IS THE LARGEST GLOBAL SOURCE OF NH3  AND BUT THERE ARE ALSO APPRECIABLE EMISSIONS OF NH3 FROM BIOMASS BURNING. HOWEVER  MAJOR UNCERTAINTIES EXIST IN NH3 EMISSION RATES FROM ALL SOURCES  AND ON ALL SCALES. THIS IS DUE TO SPARSE QUALITY IN SITU MEASUREMENTS. MEASUREMENTS FROM SATELLITE INSTRUMENTS PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR CAPTURING THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF NH3  ESPECIALLY OUTSIDE EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA  WHERE MONITORING NETWORKS RANGE FROM LIMITED TO NON-EXISTENT. THE NASA TROPOSPHERIC EMISSION SPECTROMETER (TES) WAS THE FIRST SATELLITE INSTRUMENT TO MEASURE NH3 FROM SPACE; TES CAPTURED SEASONAL VARIABILITY OVER LARGE REGIONS  AND DETECTEDHOT SPOTS OVER INDIA AND CHINA. TES ALSO REVEALED NH3 EMISSIONS FROM BIOMASS BURNING IN SOUTH AMERICA AND AFRICA  WHICH WERE ALSO OBSERVED BY THE METOP INFRARED ATMOSPHERIC SOUNDER INSTRUMENT (IASI) INSTRUMENT. NEW NH3 OBSERVATIONS FROM THE SNPP CROSS-TRACK INFRARED SOUNDER (CRIS) HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF NH3 DISTRIBUTIONS AND EMISSIONS BECAUSE CRIS HAS LOWER NOISE THAN IASI (0.04 K) AND SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER SPATIAL COVERAGE THAN TES. WHILE CRIS NH3 IS NOT YET AN OFFICIAL NASA PRODUCT  THE ALGORITHM WILL BECOME AN OPERATIONAL PRODUCT IN 2018. IT HAS ALREADY BEEN USED TO OBTAIN NH3 OVER CANADA  CALIFORNIA AND THE SOUTHEASTERN US  AS WELL AS OVER A NUMBER OF AERONET SITES. THESE DATA ARE CURRENTLY BEING VALIDATED AGAINST GROUND BASED FTIR AND AIRCRAFT NH3 MEASUREMENTS  AND HAVE PROVIDED INFORMATION ON THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF NH3 OVER THESE REGIONS. WE PROPOSE TO REFINE THE ALGORITHM WITH SOME CONTINUED VALIDATION AND TO DEMONSTRATE THE UTILITY OF THE CRIS NH3 DATA BY APPLYING SOME NOVEL APPROACHES TO OBTAIN EMISSION ESTIMATES AND SOURCE LOCATIONS. WE WILL: A) USE A TESSELLATION TECHNIQUE TO EXTRACT SUB-PIXEL INFORMATION FROM REPEATED CRIS OVERPASSES. THIS WILL PROVIDE MORE PRECISE LOCATIONS OF SOURCES OF HIGH NH3 EMISSIONS.

THE MICROWAVE AND HYPER-SPECTRAL INFRARED SOUNDERS ABOARD EOS/ AQUA AND SUOMI NPP PROVIDE A DIRECT AND DIAGNOSTIC MEASURE OF THE ATMOSPHERIC STATE WITH DAILY GLOBAL SPATIAL COVERAGE. ONE OF THE MAIN CHALLENGES IN BUILDING A CONTINUOUS RECORD OF SOUNDER PRODUCTS FROM EOS AND SUOMI NPP IS THE DIFFERENCE IN ORBITS AND INSTRUMENTATION (E.G.  GRATING VERSUS INTERFEROMETER); BOTH AFFECTING TEMPORAL  SPATIAL  AND SPECTRAL SAMPLING. LEFT UNTREATED AND UNCHARACTERIZED  SYSTEMATIC DIFFERENCES SUCH AS THESE CAN LEAD TO ERRORS THAT DISRUPTS DATA CONTINUITY LEADING TO MISTRUST IN THE VALUE OF SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS. QUANTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF ALL SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY IS CRITICAL FOR LONG-TERM SCIENCE QUALITY DATASETS THAT PROMOTES AN ACCURATE AND RELIABLE UNDERSTANDING OF WEATHER OR CLIMATE PROCESSES. WE PROPOSE TO FINALIZE THE COMMUNITY LONG-TERM INFRARED MICROWAVE COUPLED ATMOSPHERIC PRODUCT SYSTEM (CLIMCAPS) ALGORITHM  THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY SELECTED FOR DEVELOPMENT UNDER ROSES 2013 A.29 SUOMI-NPP PROGRAM ELEMENT. CLIMCAPS HAS BEEN INSTALLED AT THE NASA SOUNDER SIPS WITH A TRAINED STAFF THAT UNDERSTANDS BOTH THE THEORETICAL AND CODING ASPECTS. PRIOR TO THE START OF THIS PROPOSED WORK  WE WILL HAVE FULLY CHARACTERIZED CLIMCAPS RELATIVE TO REANALYSIS PRODUCTS AND OTHER ALGORITHMS. CLIMCAPS IS FULLY CONFIGURABLE TO RUN ON MEASUREMENTS FROM THE EOS/AQUA (AIRS/AMSU) AND SUOMI NPP OR JPSS (CRIS/ATMS) PLATFORMS. CLIMCAPS MAINTAINS PRODUCT CONTINUITY AND CONSISTENCY THROUGH REFERENCE TO A COMMON FRAMEWORK OF LABORATORY SPECTROSCOPY AND GEOPHYSICAL STATES (KNOWN AS THE A-PRIORI)  USING AN OPTIMAL ESTIMATION INVERSION APPROACH. FOR TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE PROFILES CLIMCAPS USES THE NASA MERRA-2 RE-ANALYSIS AS AN A-PRIORI WHILE TRACE GAS PRODUCTS USE A STATIC CLIMATOLOGY. WE WILL DEMONSTRATE THE PERFORMANCE OF CLIMCAPS IN THE CONTEXT OF INTER-ANNUAL VARIABILITY  EXTREME EVENTS AND LARGE-SCALE PROCESSES SUCH AS THE ENSO CYCLE AND ARCTIC WARMING USING A CAREFULLY SELECTED SUB-SET OF MONTHS. IN ADDITION TO THE STANDARD SOUNDING PRODUCTS  THIS ALGORITHM RETRIEVES MANY TRACE GAS SPECIES (E.G.  OZONE  CARBON MONOXIDE  METHANE  CARBON DIOXIDE  SULFUR DIOXIDE  NITRIC ACID  AND NITROUS OXIDE). TRACE GAS RETRIEVALS NOT ONLY PROVIDE LONG-TERM STABILITY IN THE THERMODYNAMIC SOUNDING PRODUCTS BUT ALSO OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS SCIENCE QUESTIONS RELATED TO AIR QUALITY AND  POTENTIALLY  GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL ENHANCE THE UTILITY OF CLIMCAPS PRODUCTS BY PROVIDING DIAGNOSTIC METRICS THAT QUANTIFY ERROR PROPAGATION AND CHARACTERIZE RETRIEVAL QUALITY TO COMMUNITY-ACCEPTED REFERENCE STANDARDS (E.G.

THIS EVOLUTION IS OBSERVED TO TAKE MANY FORMS  RANGING FROM SLOW  GRADUAL ADJUSTMENTS TO MORE DYNAMIC SHIFTS EMBODIED BY FILAMENT ERUPTIONS  FLARES  AND CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS. BECAUSE THE MORPHOLOGIES OF THESE MORE ENERGETIC EVENTS ARE MOST LIKELY INFLUENCED BY THE MAGNETIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH SUCH ACTIVITY IS EMBEDDED  IT IS USEFUL TO STUDY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TOPOLOGY OF THE LARGE-SCALE CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD AND THE OCCURRENCE AND NON-OCCURRENCE OF ERUPTIVE EVENTS. INVESTIGATING THESE RELATIONSHIPS IS EXPECTED TO LEAD TO A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE CORONA EVOLVES AND THE CAPABILITY TO BETTER PREDICT THESE EVENTS. THE LOCATIONS OF TOPOLOGICAL NULL POINTS (WHERE ALL COMPONENTS OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD VANISH) AND SEPARATOR FIELD LINES THAT CONNECT THESE NULL POINTS ARE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST AS THEY ARE THEORIZED TO BE PREFERENTIAL LOCATIONS FOR THE RECONNECTION NEEDED FOR AN ERUPTION TO OCCUR. ADDITIONALLY  THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SOLAR WIND APPEAR TO BE DETERMINED (AT LEAST IN PART) BY THE LARGE-SCALE TOPOLOGY OF THE CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD.

SCIENCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: THE OVERARCHING SCIENCE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DETERMINE HOW IONS ARE TRANSPORTED ACROSS THE LOW-LATITUDE BOUNDARY LAYER ON THE FLANKS OF THE MAGNETOSPHERE  AND WHETHER THERE ARE SYSTEMATIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DAWN AND DUSK. THE MAGNETOSPHERIC FLANKS ARE THE LOCATION OF A RANGE OF TRANSIENT PHENOMENA INCLUDING KELVIN-HELMHOLTZ INSTABILITIES (KHI)  FLUX TRANSFER EVENTS  AND SOLAR WIND DISCONTINUITIES THAT CAN AFFECT ION TRANSPORT. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE PROCESSES DEPENDS ON THE LOCAL CONDITIONS INCLUDING POLARITY OF THE VORTICITY (FOR KHI)  FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MAGNETOSHEATH  AND THE PLASMA MASS DENSITY (AND HENCE THE ION COMPOSITION). BECAUSE THE LOCAL CONDITIONS MAY DIFFER ON THE DAWN AND DUSK SIDE  THE TRANSPORT MAY ALSO DIFFER. SPECIFIC SCIENCE QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE SCIENCE GOAL OF THIS INVESTIGATION ARE: 1) HOW MUCH TRANSPORT OF PLASMA IS THERE ACROSS THE DAWN AND DUSK FLANKS  2) HOW DOES THE TRANSPORT VARY WITH ION SPECIES?  AND 3) HOW DO LOCAL CONDITIONS AND PROCESSES AFFECT THE TRANSPORT? 2. LISTING OF MISSION DATA TO BE USED IN THIS INVESTIGATION: MMS FPI MOMENTS AND DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS MMS HPCA MOMENTS AND DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS MMS EIS ENERGETIC PLASMA OBSERVATIONS MMS FGM MAGNETIC FIELD OBSERVATIONS THEMIS IESA MOMENTS AND DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS THEMIS FGM MAGNETIC FIELD OBSERVATIONS 3. LISTING OF DATA ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY AND MODELS AND SIMULATIONS: DURING MARCH-APRIL 2016  THE MMS SPACECRAFT WERE ON THE DAWNSIDE FLANK WITH AN APOGEE OF ~12 RE  WHILE THE THEMIS SPACECRAFT (WITH SIMILAR APOGEES) SAMPLED THE DUSKSIDE FLANK. APPROXIMATELY SIX MONTHS EARLIER  AND SIX MONTHS LATER  THE DAWN/DUSK CONFIGURATION IS REVERSED. TO ANSWER THE FIRST TWO QUESTIONS  THE CHANGES IN THE ENERGY SPECTRA ACROSS THE LOW LATITUDE BOUNDARY LAYER AT DAWN AND DUSK WILL BE DETERMINED. THE ION COMPOSITION MEASUREMENTS FROM MMS HPCA AND EIS WILL BE USED TO SHOW HOW THESE CHANGES DEPEND ON ION SPECIES. WHILE THEMIS ONLY HAS ALL-ION MEASUREMENTS  THE CHANGES IN THE SPECTRA FROM MAGNETOSHEATH-LIKE TO MAGNETOSPHERE-LIKE CAN STILL BE DETERMINED. BY USING BOTH THE SIMULTANEOUS MEASUREMENTS ON THE DAWN AND DUSK FLANKS  AND THE TWO PHASES (MMS AT DAWN  THEMIS DUSK  AND VICE VERSA) THE DIFFERENCES IN TRANSPORT BETWEEN DAWN AND DUSK FOR THE MAJOR SPECIES CAN BE DETERMINED. TO ANSWER THE THIRD QUESTION  TWO TYPES OF STUDIES WILL BE PERFORMED. FIRST  THE MEASUREMENTS WILL BE SORTED BY LOCAL PARAMETERS TO DETERMINE WHAT CONDITIONS FAVOR PARTICULAR TRANSIENT PHENOMENON. SECOND  THE DATA WILL BE SORTED BY THE TYPE OF TRANSIENT PHENOMENA OBSERVED TO DETERMINE HOW THE TRANSPORT VARIES DUE TO THE DIFFERENT PROCESSES. COMPARING THE RESULTS FROM THESE STUDIES AT DAWN AND DUSK WILL RESOLVE OUR OVERALL QUESTION. ADDITIONAL SPACE AND GROUND-BASED ASSETS (E.G.  CLUSTER  ALL-SKY IMAGERS  ETC.) MAY BE USED WHEN AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION WHEN FAVORABLY LOCATED DURING THE TIME INTERVALS OF STUDY. 4. RELEVANCE OF THE PROPOSED PROBLEM: THIS PROPOSAL DIRECTLY SUPPORTS THE GOALS OF THE MMS MISSION OF UNDERSTANDING THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE SOLAR WIND AND MAGNETOSPHERE VIA THE TRANSFER OF PLASMA ACROSS THE MAGNETOPAUSE. THIS PROPOSAL ALSO DIRECTLY ADDRESSES GOAL #2 OF THE HELIOPHYSICS DECADAL SURVEY: DETERMINE THE DYNAMICS AND COUPLING OF EARTHS MAGNETOSPHERE  IONOSPHERE  AND ATMOSPHERE AND THEIR RESPONSE TO SOLAR AND TERRESTRIAL INPUTS.

"ADNET SYSTEMS  INC.","","United States","","","","","SCIENCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: TO CONSTRAIN THE PARAMETERS OF NANOFLARE HEATING MODELS THAT GENERATE SUFFICIENT THERMAL ENERGY TO HEAT ACTIVE REGIONS (ARS).IT HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR DECADES THAT THE OVERLYING SOLAR CORONA IS MUCH HOTTER THAN THE UNDERLYING PHOTOSPHERE. ALSO  THE REQUIRED ENERGY DEPOSITION RATE IS MUCH HIGHER IN ARS COMPARED TO CORONAL HOLES OR THE QUIET SUN. MANY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT AN ENERGY DEPOSITION MECHANISM MUST BE OPERATING IN THE SOLAR CORONA TO MAINTAIN THE TEMPERATURES OBSERVED. A LEADING THEORY IS THAT THE CORONA IS HEATED BY LARGE NUMBER OF SMALL ENERGY RELEASE EVENTS KNOWN AS NANOFLARES. A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE NUMBER OF NANOFLARES  WITH SUFFICIENTLY HIGH OCCURRENCE RATE  CAN PROVIDE ENOUGH ENERGY TO HEAT THE CORONA. INSTRUMENTATION LIMITATIONS MEAN THAT NANOFLARES ARE NOT OBSERVED DIRECTLY: THEREFORE  MUCH OF THE EVIDENCE FOR THEIR EXISTENCE IS INFERRED FROM OBSERVATIONS AND NUMERICAL MODELING. DETERMINING THE ENERGY DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE RATE OF NANOFLARES IN THE AR CORONA WOULD BE A HUGE STEP FORWARD IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HEATING IN CORONAL PLASMAS. VIALL&KLIMCHUK 2011  2013  2014  2017 HAVE SHOWN THAT THE TIMING OF AR CORONAL EMISSION BRIGHTENINGS IN MULTIPLE CHANNELS OF SOLAR DYNAMICS OBSERVATORY ATMOSPHERIC IMAGING ASSEMBLY (SDO/AIA) FOLLOWS THAT EXPECTED FROM SIMULATIONS OF A NANOFLARE-HEATED CORONA. USING NUMERICAL HYDRODYNAMIC RADIATIVE EMISSION MODEL FOR THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE (HYDRAD)-BASED SIMULATIONS OF AIA EMISSION FOR AN AR  BRADSHAW&VIALL 2016 HAVE SHOWN THAT THE TIMING OF CORONAL EMISSION BRIGHTENINGS IS DEPENDENT ON THE PROPERTIES OF THE NANOFLARE ENERGY DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE RATE.

IRELAND ET AL. 2015 SHOW THAT A DISTRIBUTION OF EXPONENTIALLY DECAYING EVENTS OF EMISSION E ALONG THE LINE-OF-SIGHT (LOS)  WHERE N(E)~E^(-M) AND THE SIZE OF THE EMISSION DEPENDS ON ITS DURATION T SUCH THAT E~T^K CREATES A POWER LAW POWER SPECTRUM P(F)~F^-K(2-M). CONSEQUENTLY  WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT A DISTRIBUTION OF NANOFLARE EVENTS CAUSES BOTH THE EMISSION POWER-LAW POWER SPECTRUM IN AIA TIME-SERIES AS WELL AS THE OBSERVED BRIGHTENING TIME-LAGS. THEREFORE  WE WILL USE THE AIA EMISSION POWER-LAW POWER SPECTRA AND BRIGHTENING TIME-LAGS IN COMBINATION FOR THE FIRST TIME AS CONSTRAINTS ON THE ENERGY DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE RATE OF NANOFLARES. METHODOLOGY: WE WILL STUDY THE FOURIER POWER SPECTRA OF THE EMISSION GENERATED BY SIMULATED NANOFLARE ENERGY DEPOSITION EVENTS  AND COMPARE THAT TO THE OBSERVED FOURIER POWER SPECTRA FOR THE ARS STUDIED BY VIALL&KLIMCHUK 2012  2017 AND WARREN ET AL. 2012. WE WILL USE THE ENTHALPY BASED THERMAL EVOLUTION OF LOOPS (EBTEL) AND HYDRAD NUMERICAL MODELS APPLIED TO AR MAGNETIC SKELETONS TO CALCULATE THE EMISSION ALONG THE LOS. THE TOTAL EMISSION MEASURE WILL THEN BE FOLDED THROUGH THE INSTRUMENT RESPONSE OF AIA. BY COMPARING THE OBSERVED AND SIMULATED AIA POWER SPECTRA IN ALL CHANNELS  AND SIMULTANEOUSLY REQUIRING THAT THE OBSERVED AND SIMULATED AIA EMISSION HAVE THE SAME CROSS-AIA CHANNEL TIME-LAG PROPERTIES  WE WILL DISCOVER IMPORTANT NEW CONSTRAINTS ON THE POSSIBLE DISTRIBUTIONS AND FREQUENCY RATES OF NANOFLARES THAT REPRODUCE THE OBSERVED EMISSION.

THESE MEASUREMENTS ASSIST IN ANSWERING QUESTIONS OF THE EARTHS RADIATION IMBALANCE AND FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE. THE UNCERTAINTY GOALS OF LESS-THAN 1.5 PERCENT FOR NISTAR ARE VERY CHALLENGING  AND THEY REQUIRE A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION TO BOTH THE GROUND CALIBRATION AND DETERMINATION OF THE ON-ORBIT DEGRADATION OF THE INSTRUMENT. THIS CHALLENGE HAS BEEN COMPLICATED BY DIFFERENCES IN THE THERMAL ENVIRONMENT DURING GROUND TESTING COMPARED TO THAT DURING OPERATION IN-SPACE. THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE IS THAT IN SPACE THE THERMAL BACKGROUND CONTRIBUTES MUCH MORE TO THE SIGNAL OF INTEREST THAN IT DID DURING LABORATORY TESTING. THE ISSUE MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO PROPERLY TUNE THE INSTRUMENT TIME RESPONSE ON-ORBIT WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR ACCURATE USE OF THE GROUND CALIBRATION. SO FAR  EFFORTS TO TUNE THE INSTRUMENT APPEAR TO BE SUCCESSFUL  HOWEVER  THE DEGREE OF SUCCESS HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY PRECISELY. A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE NISTAR SHORT-WAVE DATA AND SYNTHETIC DATA DERIVED FROM OTHER EARTH VIEWING SENSORS REVEALS A DISAGREEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY 15 PERCENT.

THE ANALYSIS DOES NOT RELY ON OTHER EARTH OBSERVATION DATA  JUST THAT COLLECTED BY NISTAR.

AS ONE ASPECT OF SPACE WEATHER  SOLAR ENERGETIC PARTICLE (SEP) EVENTS ARE A SIGNIFICANT HAZARD DIRECTLY TO ASTRONAUTS (THROUGH INCREASED RADIATION LEVELS) AND SATELLITES (CAUSING E.G.  SINGLE-EVENT UPSETS  GHOST COMMANDS  SOLAR CELL DAMAGE)  AS WELL AS INDIRECTLY THROUGH IONIZATION OF THE IONOSPHERE  INTERFERING WITH RADIO COMMUNICATIONS. WHILE THE BASIC PROCESS OF ACCELERATING SEPS AT SHOCKS DRIVEN BY CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS (CMES) IS FAIRLY WELL UNDERSTOOD  THE DETAILS THAT LEAD TO THE SUBSTANTIAL VARIATION IN SEP COMPOSITION OBSERVED AT 1 AU REMAIN ELUSIVE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY UNDERSCORED BY THE OBSERVATION OF LARGE FE-RICH SEP EVENTS WHICH SEVERELY CALLED INTO QUESTION THE EXISTING SIMPLE TWO-CLASS PARADIGM OF SEP EVENTS (THOUGHT TO REPRESENT TWO DISTINCT ACCELERATION MECHANISMS). TO DATE  COMPETING HYPOTHESES FOR THE GENERATION OF THESE EVENTS HAVE NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY TESTED TO ACHIEVE RESOLUTION AND FURTHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF PARTICLE ACCELERATION NEAR THE SUN. WE PROPOSE A TWO-PRONGED APPROACH TO ADVANCE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF SEP COMPOSITIONAL VARIATIONS. WE WILL USE SOPHISTICATED MODELING OF THE CME AND MAGNETIC FIELD ENVIRONMENT NEAR THE SUN AND DETAILED SEP AND SOLAR EVENT STUDIES UTILIZING THE STATE OF THE ART INSTRUMENTATION ON ACE  STEREO  SDO  AND SOHO TO ANSWER OUR CENTRAL QUESTION: HOW IS THE COMPOSITIONAL VARIABILITY OF SEP EVENTS INFLUENCED BY THE MAGNETIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY OCCUR? AND THE SECONDARY QUESTION: WHAT IS THE ROLE OF PRE-EVENT SOLAR ACTIVITY? A STRONG IMPEDIMENT TO PROGRESS ON THESE QUESTIONS HAS BEEN THE LACK OF INFORMATION ON THE CONDITIONS OF THE SHOCK WAVE CONNECTED TO THE OBSERVER THROUGHOUT THE SEP EVENT  INCLUDING THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE SHOCK SURFACE NORMAL AND THE MAGNETIC FIELD AND THE SHOCK COMPRESSION RATIO AND ALFVEN MACH NUMBER. THESE QUANTITIES ARE HARD TO DETERMINE OR ESTIMATE FROM REMOTE-SENSING OBSERVATIONS ALONE. WE WILL USE THE 3D MHD MODEL SWMF/AWSOM  WHICH CAN REPRODUCE MOST OF THE OBSERVED FEATURES IN THE CORONA QUANTITATIVELY WITH UNPRECEDENTED FIDELITY  TO ACCESSIN-SITU MEASUREMENTS OF THE CME-DRIVEN SHOCK WAVES FROM THE CORONA OUTWARD. THESE WILL THEN BE STUDIED IN CONNECTION WITH DETAILED SEP COMPOSITIONAL ANALYSIS AT A LEVEL THAT HAS NOT BEEN PERFORMED FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF CYCLE 24 EVENTS (AND SOME CYCLE 23 EVENTS). THE SOLAR STUDIES WE PROPOSE WILL BE USED TO RELATE THE PRECEDING SOLAR STRUCTURE AND ACTIVITY  AS WELL AS DETAILED EVENT ERUPTION ANALYSIS  TO BOTH THE EVOLUTION OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD AS CALCULATED BY AWSOM AND THE RESULTING SEP CHARACTERISTICS. FINALLY THE ROLE OF SUPRATHERMALS WILL BE INVESTIGATED THROUGH SYSTEMATIC COMPARISONS OF THE COMPOSITION OF UPSTREAM SUPRATHERMAL PARTICLES TO THAT OF SEP EVENTS  THE CONNECTION BETWEEN CERTAIN TYPES OF SOLAR ACTIVITY (E.G.  CORONAL JETS) TO OBSERVED 3HE-RICH SEP EVENTS  AND A SURVEY OF THE FULL COMPOSITIONAL VARIABILITY OF 3HERICH SEP EVENTS IN CYCLE 24 (WHICH HAS NOT BEEN DONE) AND SUBSEQUENT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CYCLE 23 AND 24.

"NORTHWEST RESEARCH ASSOCIATES  INC.","","United States","","","","","SCIENCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES WE PROPOSE TO EXPLORE MECHANISMS BY WHICH DISTURBANCES IN ONE REGION OF THE ATMOSPHERE PRODUCE A RESPONSE IN A DISTANT REGION. OUR INTEREST IS TO EXAMINE THE SPECIFIC EFFECTS OF VARIOUS LARGE AMPLITUDE WAVES ON THE MLT: THE QUASI TWO-DAY WAVE (2DW); THE NONMIGRATING SEMIDIURNAL TIDE (SW1) NONLINEARLY GENERATED THROUGH INTERACTION OF THE MIGRATING SW2 AND WINTER PLANETARY WAVES; THE TOTALITY OF THE TROPICAL WAVE SPECTRUM. WE WILL EXAMINE THE FULL LIFE CYCLE OF THESE THREE WAVE PHENOMENA: SOURCE  PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS  AND THE GLOBAL EFFECT OF THEIR DISSIPATION ON MEAN FLOW AND MEAN MERIDIONAL CIRCULATION (MMC). MMCS FORCED BY TRANSIENT MOMENTUM DEPOSITION INTO A MEAN FLOW SUBJECT TO DIFFUSIVE MECHANISMS CAN EXTEND LATERALLY FAR FROM THE FORCING REGION AND CONTAIN UPWARD CIRCULATION CELLS. THE MMC GENERATED BY THE 2DW IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST. AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENT REQUIRES UNDERSTANDING ITS EXCITATION MECHANISMS. THE SW1 IS A REMARKABLE EXAMPLE OF WAVE PROPAGATION FROM THE WINTER STRATOSPHERE TO THE SUMMER POLAR MESOSPHERE  WHERE ITS WIND COMPONENTS HAVE STRONG MAGNITUDE. TROPICAL WAVES THAT DEPOSIT MOMENTUM IN THE THERMOSPHERE ARE FILTERED BY A MEAN FLOW THAT VARIES ON MULTIPLE TIME SCALES AND WHICH IS SUBJECT TO FORCING BY WINTER HEMISPHERE PW. SPECIFIC QUESTIONS 1) DOES THE EXISTENCE OF THE 2DW DEPEND ON THE BAROCLINIC/BAROTROPIC INSTABILITY OF THE SUMMER MESOSPHERE MEAN FLOW? WHAT ROLE DO TROPICAL OR SYNOPTIC WAVES PLAY IN THE EXCITATION OF THE 2DW? HOW DOES THE LIFE CYCLE OF THE 2DW CONTRIBUTE TO THE MMC OVER THE SUMMER POLE? 2) WHAT ARE THE DETAILS OF THE FORCING OF SW1 THROUGH NONLINEAR INTERACTION BETWEEN PW1 AND SW2? HOW DOES THE STRUCTURE OF THE MEAN FLOW CONTROL THE TRANSMISSION OF SW1? WHAT IS THE STRUCTURE OF THE MMC FORCED BY THE DISSIPATION OF SW1? 3) TO WHAT EXTENT DOES THE FILTERING OF TROPICAL WAVES BY THE SSAO MODULATE THE MSAO? DO SEASONAL DIFFERENCES IN THE MSAO CONTRIBUTE  THROUGH LATERAL EXTENSION OF THE MMC  TO VARIABILITY AT THE POLES AND ASYMMETRY BETWEEN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN SUMMER CONDITIONS? METHODOLOGY OUR DATA TOOL WILL BE SABER TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS SUPPLEMENTED BY MLS TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS OVER THE POLE NOT COVERED BY SABER. SATELLITE TEMPERATURES WILL BE UTILIZED FOR ANALYSIS OF VARIOUS WAVES. THESE WAVE DEFINITIONS WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR SELECTING CASE STUDIES  AND THE VALIDATION OF NUMERICALLY PREDICTED MERIDIONAL CIRCULATIONS VIA SHORT-TERM CHANGES IN THE ZONAL MEAN TEMPERATURE. OUR MODELLING TOOLS WILL BE: 1) A SPECIFIED DYNAMICS MECHANISTIC WAVE MODEL FORCED WITH TROPICAL AND SOLAR HEATING  WITH MEAN FLOW AND STATIONARY PW DERIVED FROM OBSERVATIONS. IT WILL BE USED TO EXAMINE THE 2DW LIFE CYCLE  ASPECTS OF MSAO DYNAMICS RELATED TO TROPICAL WAVE PROPAGATION AND DEPOSITION  NONMIGRATING TIDE PROPAGATION THROUGH MEAN FLOW VARIATIONS  AND NONLINEAR TIDE GENERATION. 2) A TIME-DEPENDENT ZONALLY SYMMETRIC TRANSFORMED EULERIAN MEAN MODEL FORCED BY THE EP FLUX DIVERGENCE CALCULATED FROM THE MODEL OR DATA STUDIES TO CALCULATE THE MMC AND MEAN FLOW PERTURBATION THAT RESULT FROM THE WAVE FORCING. SIGNIFICANCE AND RELEVANCE TO NASA OBJECTIVES OUR COMPREHENSIVE STUDY WILL QUANTIFY THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF WAVE DRIVEN CIRCULATIONS TO GLOBAL TELECONNECTIONS. THIS WILL ENHANCE THE UNDERSTANDING OF SEASONAL AND INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY OF THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE; NEUTRAL ATMOSPHERE FORCING OF THE IONOSPHERE; PMC AS GLOBAL CHANGE PROXIES.

"PREDICTIVE SCIENCE INCORPORATED","","United States","","","","","IN SPITE OF INTENSE STUDY OVER MORE THAN FORTY YEARS  MANY BASIC QUESTIONS ON THE INITIATION AND EVOLUTION OF CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS (CMES) REMAIN UNSOLVED. THIS PARTICULARLY REFERS TO SYMPATHETIC OR MULTIPLE ERUPTIONS  WHICH OCCUR WITHIN A RELATIVELY SHORT TIME AT DIFFERENT  OFTEN WIDELY SEPARATED  LOCATIONS. PROGRESS IN UNDERSTANDING THESE PHENOMENA HAS BEEN MADE IN RECENT STUDIES OF THE 2010 AUGUST 1-2 CMES (SCHRIJVER&TITLE 2011)  TO A LARGE EXTENT DUE TO SDO/AIA OBSERVATIONS NOW AVAILABLE. THESE SYMPATHETIC CMES WERE FIRST INVESTIGATED IN OUR IDEALIZED MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC (MHD) MODEL (T R K ET AL. 2011). THE MODEL WAS THEN SUBSTANTIATED (TITOV ET AL. 2012) AND CONFIRMED (MIKIC ET AL.  2011  2013)  USING POTENTIAL FIELD SOURCE SURFACE AND MHD MODELS  RESPECTIVELY  BOTH MORE TIGHTLY CONSTRAINED BY OBSERVATIONS  PARTICULARLY  FROM SOHO/MDI AND SDO/HMI. THESE STUDIES DEMONSTRATED THAT THE MAGNETIC FLUX TRANSFER BETWEEN DIFFERENT TOPOLOGICAL DOMAINS OF PSEUDO-STREAMER CONFIGURATIONS LIKELY PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN ESTABLISHING A CAUSAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ERUPTIONS AND THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY OCCUR. OUR DEVELOPMENTS PROVIDE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR A MUCH DEEPER STUDY  APPLYING NEW ADVANCED TECHNIQUES THAT WILL ALLOW US TO: (I) CONSTRUCT PRE-ERUPTIVE EQUILIBRIA WITH MULTIPLE FLUX ROPES (TITOV ET AL. 2014) AND (II) ANALYZE THE 3D TOPOLOGICAL EVOLUTION OF ERUPTING CONFIGURATIONS (TITOV 2007; TITOV ET.

THESE DEPOSITS MAY NOT BE LARGE ENOUGH TO ACCOUNT FOR THE REQUIRED CO2 SEQUESTRATION TO EXPLAIN AN EARLY WARM/WET MARS WITH A THICKER ATMOSPHERE (EDWARDS AND EHLMANN  2015).

OUR SIMULATIONS WILL ALLOW US TO THOROUGHLY TEST THESE MECHANISMS AND TO STUDY THE RESULTING DYNAMICS IN A MORE REALISTIC MAGNETIC FIELD AND PLASMA ENVIRONMENT THAN DONE SO FAR. THEY WILL ALSO PROVIDE PRE-ERUPTIVE CONFIGURATIONS FOR CME SIMULATIONS THAT CONTAIN SELF-CONSISTENTLY PRODUCED PROMINENCE PLASMA DISTRIBUTIONS.

WINDS AT THESE LEVELS GUIDE ROSSBY WAVE PROPAGATION AND TELECONNECTION PATTERNS THAT STRONGLY INFLUENCE THE SIMULATION OF REGIONAL-SCALE CLIMATE PATTERNS AND SKILL OF LONG-RANGE WEATHER FORECASTS. MOST CLIMATE AND WEATHER FORECASTING CENTERS HAVE RAISED THEIR MODEL LIDS IN RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE UPPER LEVEL WINDS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SIMULATING THE PROCESSES THAT CONTROL THEM. AT SEASONAL FORECAST MODEL RESOLUTIONS  SMALL-SCALE WAVES REMAIN SEVERELY UNDER-RESOLVED  YET THE INFLUENCE OF THEIR DRAG FORCES ON THE CIRCULATION IN THE UPPER TROPOSPHERE AND STRATOSPHERE MAKE THEM A KEY PLAYER IN PREDICTABILITY. GRAVITY WAVE DRAG PARAMETERIZATIONS THAT TREAT OROGRAPHIC AND NON-OROGRAPHIC WAVES ARE USED TO TUNE BOTH CLIMATE AND FORECAST MODELS WITH DEMONSTRATED EFFECTS ON BIAS REDUCTION AND FORECAST SKILL. THIS PROJECT WILL INFORM IMPROVED METHODS FOR SIMULATING SMALL-SCALE WAVE EFFECTS ON TWO IMPORTANT FEATURES OF THE CIRCULATION WITH DEMONSTRATED INFLUENCE ON SEASONAL PREDICTABILITY: THE TROPICAL LOWER STRATOSPHERE AND THE WINTER SEASON STRATOSPHERIC VORTEX. THIS PUTS OUR FOCUS ON OROGRAPHIC GRAVITY WAVES AND THOSE GENERATED BY LOCALIZED INTENSE RAIN EVENTS. THE NASA GLOBAL MODELING AND ASSIMILATION OFFICE S (GMAO S) GEOS-5 MODEL IS DESIGNED FOR SIMULATION AT A WIDE RANGE OF ATMOSPHERIC RESOLUTIONS: FOR EXAMPLE  IT IS CURRENTLY CONFIGURED FOR CLIMATE SIMULATIONS WITH ~100 KM RESOLUTION  AND SPECIALIZED HINDCASTING EXPERIMENTS ARE ROUTINELY RUN IN THE GRAY ZONE (FOR BOTH DEEP CONVECTION AND GRAVITY WAVES) AT ~6 KM. VERTICAL RESOLUTION IS CURRENTLY 72 LEVELS WITH EFFORTS TO DOUBLE THAT UNDERWAY. ATMOSPHERIC WAVES AND THEIR INTERACTION WITH GLOBAL AND REGIONAL CIRCULATION ARE QUITE SENSITIVE TO THESE RESOLUTION CHOICES  BUT ALSO SENSITIVE TO MOIST PROCESSES  SURFACE DRAG  DIVERGENCE DAMPING  AND OTHER DISSIPATION MECHANISMS. AS A RESULT  RESOLUTION ALONE DICTATES NEITHER THE SCALES OF THE WAVES THAT CAN BE RESOLVED NOR OTHER WAVE PROPERTIES INCLUDING THEIR SOURCES  GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS  AND DRAG ON THE CIRCULATION. FOR EXAMPLE  PREVIOUS HIGHRESOLUTION EXPERIMENTS  LIKE THE 7-KM RESOLUTION NATURE RUN  NEEDED STRONG PARAMETERIZED GRAVITY WAVES TO COUNTERACT THE EFFECTS OF EXPLICIT PLUS IMPLICIT DISSIPATION ON WAVES RESOLVED IN THE MODEL. THE PROJECT APPROACH INCLUDES (I) OBSERVATIONAL VALIDATION OF GRAVITY WAVES AND SMALL-SCALE HEAVY PRECIPITATION EVENTS IN EXISTING AND FUTURE HIGH-RESOLUTION SIMULATIONS WITH DIFFERENT DISSIPATION SETTINGS  (II) EXPLORATORY LIMITED-AREA HIGH-RESOLUTION GEOS EXPERIMENTS TO PROBE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PHYSICS  DISSIPATION  AND RESOLUTION SETTINGS ON SMALL-SCALE RESOLVED GRAVITY WAVES AND LATENT HEATING SOURCES  (III) AN UPDATE TO THE EXISTING OROGRAPHIC GRAVITY WAVE DRAG PARAMETERIZATION TO INCLUDE EFFECTS OF ANISOTROPY AND LOW-LEVEL WAVE TRAPPING  AND (IV) ANALYSIS OF VALIDATED GLOBAL MODEL EXPERIMENTS TO INFER THE ROLES OF SMALL-SCALE WAVES ON MAJOR MODES OF VARIABILITY AND ON WIND BIASES. THE WORK IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT IN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRECISE ROLES OF SMALL-SCALE WAVES ON CIRCULATION  AND WILL ALSO INFORM THE GMAO S PLANNED FY 2019 TESTS OF A NEW PROTOTYPE GEOS MODEL THROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF A VARIETY OF MODEL SETTING CHOICES ON SMALL-SCALE WAVES AND GRID-SCALE PRECIPITATION.","","2018","$284,685","$0","$284,685","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Washington", "","","","",""

THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS TO FURTHER THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS SENSOR AND TO VERIFY IN-ORBIT CALIBRATION PROCEDURES BY FLYING IT ON A HIGH ALTITUDE BALLOON. THIS WILL BRING THE DWTS TECHNOLOGY TO A HIGH TRL LEVEL IN PREPARATION FOR ORBITAL OPERATIONS. OBJECTIVE DETAILS: THE PROJECT OBJECTIVES ARE TO 1. BUILD A PROTOTYPE DWTS INSTRUMENT  2. DEMONSTRATE THE REQUIRED PERFORMANCE OF THE CRITICAL SUBSYSTEMS IN THE LABORATORY  THEN 3. FURTHER DEMONSTRATE THE PERFORMANCE ON A NUMBER OF HIGH ALTITUDE BALLOON FLIGHTS THAT WILL EXERCISE THE IN-ORBIT CALIBRATION PROCEDURES. MOST CRITICAL OF THESE IS THE CALIBRATION AND REMOVAL OF STRAY LIGHT FOR WHICH WE WILL DEMONSTRATE THE EFFICACY OF ON-BOARD PROCEDURES USING THE SUN AND MOON AS NATURAL CALIBRATION SOURCES. GATS INC. OF NEWPORT NEWS  VA WILL LEAD INSTRUMENT DESIGN  DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION THROUGH CONTRACTS TO LASP OF BOULDER  CO AND BRANDYWINE PHOTONICS OF EXTON  PA. INSTRUMENT TESTING WILL PRODUCE DETAILED CHARACTERIZATION OF THE INSTRUMENT  INCLUDING  BUT NOT LIMITED TO  ABSOLUTE PIXEL RESPONSE  SPECTRAL RESPONSE  STRAY LIGHT  PIXEL FLAT FIELDING  AND RESPONSE TO THERMAL CHANGES. WE WILL ALSO DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE AN ON-BOARD DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM REQUIRED FOR AN ORBITING DWTS INSTRUMENT.

THIS WORK WILL ALSO BE PART OF A SMALL SATELLITE INITIATIVE DESIGNED TO TRAIN VIRGINIA TECH STUDENTS IN SPACE MISSION TECHNOLOGY. ALL DWTS SENSOR COMPONENTS ARE COMMERCIAL-OFF-THE-SHELF  OR MINOR MODIFICATION OF COTS COMPONENTS. SIGNIFICANCE: DWTS IS A VERY SIMPLE SYSTEM COMPOSED OF ONE OR MORE CHANNELS  WITH EACH CHANNEL COMPRISED OF AN IR CAMERA AND SPECTRAL FILTERING PROVIDED BY A GAS CELL ALONG WITH A BROADBAND FILTER. BY USING A NOVEL IMPLEMENTATION OF GAS FILTER CORRELATION RADIOMETRY (GFCR)  THIS SIMPLE  SMALL  STATIC  INEXPENSIVE IR CAMERA CAN MEASURE THE DOPPLER BROADENING AND SHIFT OF THERMAL EMISSION SPECTRA  ALLOWING THE SIMULTANEOUS INFERENCE OF WIND AND TEMPERATURE FROM LOWER MID STRATOSPHERE TO OVER 200 KILOMETERS  CONTINUOUSLY  DAY AND NIGHT  EVERY 10 KILOMETERS ALONG-TRACK. DWTS COULD REVOLUTIONIZE GLOBAL MONITORING OF UPPER ALTITUDE WINDS AND TEMPERATURE. THEREFORE  THE DATA PROVIDED BY SUCH A SYSTEM DIRECTLY ADDRESSES ITM SCIENCE. BEYOND THE ITM  DATA FROM A CONSTELLATION OF DWTS SENSORS COULD PROVIDE THE NEXT LEAP IN BOTH LONG-TERM SURFACE WEATHER FORECASTING AND SPACE WEATHER  NOW CASTING   BY SUPPLYING GLOBAL COVERAGE OF HIGH ALTITUDE TEMPERATURE AND WINDS AT UNPRECEDENTED ACCURACY AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION. IN ADDITION  THE INSTRUMENTS WILL PROVIDE A WEALTH OF THERMOSPHERE RESEARCH DATA  INCLUDING THE EXTENSION OF TEMPERATURE AND NITRIC OXIDE EMISSION PRODUCTS NOW BEING SUPPLIED BY THE SABER INSTRUMENT ON THE AGING HSO TIMED MISSION. DWTS MEASUREMENTS WOULD DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE NASA HELIOPHYSICS STP PROGRAM GOAL OF UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMICAL COUPLING BETWEEN LOWER AND UPPER ATMOSPHERE. DWTS COULD SUPPLY DATA TO UNDERSTAND THESE MECHANISMS CONTINUOUSLY FROM LOWER STRATOSPHERE UP TO MESOSPHERE AND INTO THE MID TO UPPER THERMOSPHERE  AND THE GOAL OF FORECASTING UPPER ATMOSPHERE WEATHER.","","2018","$302,595","$0","$302,595","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Virginia", "","","","",""

THIS DATA FLOW FORCES END-USERS TO DEVOTE SCARCE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE TRANSFER  STORAGE  AND MANAGEMENT OF ARCHIVED DATA  AS WELL AS SPECIALIST EXPERTISE IN THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT KINDS OF DATA SETS OF THEIR RESEARCH DOMAIN. WE PROPOSE TO SIMPLIFY THIS FLOW BY MOVING PREPROCESSING ACTIVITIES TO THE ARCHIVED DATA  ELIMINATING THE COSTS OF TRANSFERRING  CREATING  AND MAINTAINING REDUNDANT  IDIOSYNCRATIC LOCAL ARCHIVES  DEVELOPED BY RESEARCHERS WHO ARE GENERALLY NOT ARCHIVISTS  NOR THE EXPERT PRODUCERS OF THE ORIGINAL DATA. WITH STARE PROVIDING A UNIFYING PLATFORM FOR DIVERSE DATA MODELS (SWATH  POINT  GRID)  EOSDIS DATA ARCHIVES WILL BE ABLE TO PRODUCE HIGHER-LEVEL PRODUCTS MADE TO ORDER FOR END-USER RESEARCHERS. METHODS: THE CRITICAL  NEW TECHNOLOGY WE APPLY IS STARE. STARE'S SPATIAL COMPONENT (SC) HAS DESCENDED FROM THE HIERARCHICAL TRIANGULAR MESH (HTM) SPHERICAL INDEXING ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED FOR THE SLOAN DIGITAL SKY SURVEY  IN WHICH STORAGE AND COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY WAS KEY. THE STARE/SC RECURSIVELY DIVIDES THE EARTH'S SURFACE INTO A SET OF QUAD-TREES ALLOWING ANY POINT ON EARTH TO BE IDENTIFIED WITH A SINGLE NUMBER. THE STARE TEMPORAL COMPONENT (TC) HAS SIMILAR PROPERTIES. FOR OBSERVATIONS  THESE STARE INDICES CONTAIN BOTH LOCATION AND RESOLUTION INFORMATION  PROMOTING EFFICIENT DATA PLACEMENT ON DISTRIBUTED  CLOUD RESOURCES MINIMIZING COSTLY DATA TRANSPORT BETWEEN NODES FOR OPERATIONS SUCH AS JOINING  INTERSECTING  (CONDITIONAL) SUBSETTING  AND RE-GRIDDING DIVERSE DATASETS. STARE AUTOMATICALLY CO-ALIGNS DIVERSE DATA IN THE CLOUD  PLACING SPATIOTEMPORALLY CLOSE DATA ON THE SAME COMPUTE/STORAGE NODE  FOR A RELATIVELY SMALL COST IN METADATA. STARE THUS ALLOWS DIVERSE DATA TO BE EFFICIENTLY INTEGRATED FOR ANALYSIS IN THE CLOUD  PROVIDING A FOUNDATION ON WHICH EXISTING TOOLS AND PROCESSING METHODS CAN BE PLACED. MUCH CAPABILITY  E.G. PREPROCESSING  SEARCHING  VISUALIZATION  ETC.  HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO SUPPORT RESEARCHERS' USE OF EARTH SCIENCE DATA. IN THE COURSE OF THE PROPOSED WORK  WE WILL SHOW HOW EXISTING TOOLS AND METHODS BENEFIT FROM THE STARE-ENABLED PLATFORM. THIS CAN BE VIA A TIGHT INTEGRATION AS HAS BEEN DONE  FOR EXAMPLE  INCORPORATING STARE WITH THE DISTRIBUTED ARRAY DATABASE SCIDB  ALONG WITH RE-GRIDDING FUNCTIONS  AND FAST PARALLEL  GEOGRAPHIC INTERSECTIONS. OR CURRENT TOOLS MAY SIMPLY BE APPLIED TO THE RESULTS OF STARE-ENABLED DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING  E.G. FAST GRANULE INTERSECTION  IN A MORE CONVENTIONAL  BUT CLOUD-BASED  DATA PROCESSING FLOW. SIGNIFICANCE: AS A UNIFYING PLATFORM  STARE SUPPORTS CONVENTIONAL PROCESSING  ANALYSIS  AND VISUALIZATION TOOLS  BRINGING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MASSIVELY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF DATA RESEARCHERS CAN USE. IN THE LONGER TERM  AS TOOLS EVOLVE TO TAKE GREATER ADVANTAGE OF STARE'S INTEGRATIVE CAPABILITIES  WE CAN MOVE FROM THE CURRENT FOCUS ON THE EXPENSIVE LOW-LEVEL MANIPULATION OF DATA FILES TO AN ABILITY TO INTERACT WITH EARTH SCIENCE DATA AT A HIGHER LEVEL  WITH QUERY-BASED DECLARATIVE TOOLS AND USER INTERFACES THAT FAVOR SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY RATHER THAN DATA MANAGEMENT. AT THE VERY LEAST  STARE HELPS AUTOMATE CRITICAL SPATIOTEMPORAL FUNCTIONS WHILE MAKING EFFICIENT USE OF CLOUD COMPUTING  PROMISING TO ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR RESEARCHERS TO DEVOTE TIME  MONEY  AND EXPERTISE TO THE REDUNDANT TRANSFER OF ARCHIVED DATA TO THEIR OWN  LOCAL SYSTEMS. THE TIME AND EFFORT SAVED IMPROVES SCIENTIFIC QUALITY AND THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE CURRENT RESEARCHERS AND REDUCES THE COST-OF-ENTRY FOR OTHERS WHO MIGHT SEEK VALUE FROM EOSDIS DATA RESOURCES.","","2018","$307,821","$0","$307,821","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Maryland", "","","","",""

"ATMOSPHERIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH  INC.","","United States","","","","","THE OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ENHANCEMENTS TO THE RRTMGP RADIATION CODE TO SUPPORT KEY GMAO AND GEOS-5 PRIORITIES. RRTMGP  WHICH IS BEING DEVELOPED UNDER CURRENT SUPPORT FROM THE NASA MAP PROGRAM  IS A HIGH- PERFORMANCE RADIATION CODE DESIGNED FOR THE CURRENT GENERATION OF COMPUTATIONAL ARCHITECTURES. THE CODE IS A COMPLETELY RESTRUCTURED AND MODERN VERSION OF THE RRTMG RADIATION CODE USED IN MANY GCMS. RRTMGP PRESERVES THE STRENGTHS OF THE EXISTING RRTMG PARAMETERIZATION  ESPECIALLY THE HIGH ACCURACY OF THE K-DISTRIBUTION TREATMENT OF ABSORPTION BY GASES  BUT THE ENTIRE CODE HAS BEEN REWRITTEN TO PROVIDE HIGHLY EFFICIENT COMPUTATION ACROSS A RANGE OF ARCHITECTURES.  RRTMGP IS PLANNED TO BE THE NEXT RADIATION CODE IN GEOS-5  AND ITS INITIAL VERSION WILL BE ACCURATE FOR THE TYPICAL GCM CONFIGURATIONS OF SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION  VERTICAL RANGE  GAS ABUNDANCES  ETC.  THE ENHANCEMENTS TO RRTMGP PROPOSED HERE WILL EXTEND THE RANGE OF VALIDITY OF GEOS-5 TO SUPPORT IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC GOALS OF GMAO AND NASA-GSFC RESEARCHERS. IN PARTICULAR  WE PROPOSE TO IMPROVE RRTMGP TO SUPPORT GEOS-5 NATURE RUNS AT HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION  A CRITICAL PRIORITY FOR GMAO  BOTH BY INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF TOPOGRAPHY ON RADIATIVE FLUXES AND BY IMPLEMENTING STRATEGIES TO SPEED UP THE CODE. WE WILL ALSO ENHANCE RRTMGP TO ALLOW SOLAR VARIABILITY TO BE SIMULATED MORE ACCURATELY IN GEOS-5  TO INCLUDE THE RADIATIVE EFFECTS OF KEY HYDROFLUOROCARBONS  TO ACCURATELY COMPUTE THE RADIATION FROM MASSIVE EMISSIONS OF SULFUR DIOXIDE FROM LARGE VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS  AND TO EXTEND THE UPPER VERTICAL LIMIT OF THE CODE ABOVE 65 KM. RRTMGP ALSO INCLUDES A SATELLITE SIMULATION CAPABILITY  AND WE PROPOSE TO ADD CRIS  AIRS  IASI  AND OCO-2 TO THE SUITE OF IMPLEMENTED SENSORS.  THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE GEOS-5 REPRESENTATION OF RADIATIVE PROCESSES  OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES. THIS WORK WOULD THEREBY SUPPORT THE MAP PROGRAM OBJECTIVE OF ATTAINING A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE EARTH SYSTEM  AS WELL AS ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF GEOS-5 SIMULATIONS AND REANALYSIS PRODUCTS PRODUCED BY THE MODEL. THESE BENEFITS WOULD APPLY ACROSS THE WEATHER-TO-CLIMATE CONTINUUM OF TEMPORAL SCALES AND EXTEND TO MAP PROJECTS RELATED TO GEOS-5  SUCH AS THE GLOBAL MODELING INITIATIVE AND THE NASA UNIFIED WEATHER RESEARCH FORECAST MODEL.

THESE INTERVALS WILL SAMPLE THE ENTIRE 6+ YEARS OF THE SDO MISSION  SPANNING FROM A PERIOD OF EXTREME SOLAR QUIESCENCE TO THE SOLAR MAXIMUM AND INTO THE DECLINING PHASE OF CYCLE 24. THERE ARE FOUR MAIN COMPONENTS TO THE PROJECT: 1) WE WILL USE LOCAL HELIOSEISMIC TECHNIQUES INCLUDING BOTH TIME-DISTANCE AND HOLOGRAPHY MEASUREMENTS TO OBTAIN ACOUSTIC (P-MODE) TRAVEL TIMES FOR WAVES PROPAGATING THROUGH SUPERGRANULES. WE WILL EMPLOY ENSEMBLE AVERAGING OF MEASUREMENTS OVER TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SUPERGRANULES TO MINIMIZE NOISE. WE WILL MAKE TRAVEL-TIME MEASUREMENTS OF WAVES WITH A WIDE RANGE OF SKIP-DISTANCE IN ORDER TO SEPARATE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE MEASUREMENTS OF VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL MOTIONS WITHIN THE CONVECTIVE CELLS. 2) WE WILL INFER THE DEPTH VARIATION OF THE ENSEMBLE-AVERAGED SUPERGRANULAR FLOWS USING EXISTING  AND EASILY FINE TUNED  FORWARD MODELS OF THE FLOWS WHICH USE SENSITIVITY FUNCTIONS DERIVED THROUGH AN EMPIRICALLY-BASED SCHEME BASED ON THE BORN APPROXIMATION.

"AEOLIS RESEARCH  INC.","","United States","","","","","THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW SURFACE SOURCES AND SINKS OF WATER AT THE MARTIAN POLES INTERACT WITH THE GLOBAL CLIMATE SYSTEM. THE PROPOSAL WILL PRIMARILY USE DATA PRODUCTS FROM CRISM  MCS AND MARCI ABOARD MRO. A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION OF THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE IN THE THERMAL AND METEOROLOGICAL MODELING ""NECESSARY TO ANALYZE OR INTERPRET THE DATA"" IN TERMS OF THE WATER AND DUST CYCLES. THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO ADDRESS FOUR MAJOR QUESTIONS: - HOW IS THE LOCAL CYCLE OF WATER (AND DUST) CONTROLLED AT SITES OBSERVED BY CRISM/MCS/MARCI? - CAN SUCH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTROLS ON SURFACE WATER EXCHANGE BE SUMMARIZED INTO A PROGNOSTIC FRAMEWORK LIKE A LAND SURFACE MODEL (LSM) IN TERRESTRIAL STUDIES? - HOW IS THE GLOBAL CYCLE OF WATER AND DUST CHANGED IF BETTER REPRESENTATIONS OF THE POLAR EXCHANGE PROCESSES ARE INCLUDED IN GLOBAL MODELS? - CAN THE SEASONAL PROGNOSTIC PICTURE OF ICE AND DUST DEPOSITION AT THE POLES BE USED TO HELP UNDERSTAND THE FORMATION OF POLAR LAYERED TERRAIN? THE LATTER QUESTION SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE MDAP CALL REGARDING ""NONDATA-ANALYSIS TASKS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE USE OR FACILITATE THE INTERPRETATION OF MISSION DATA"" AS IT ALLOWS DATA ON CURRENT PROCESSES TO BE USED TO ADDRESS LONGER-TERM QUESTIONS IN MARTIAN CLIMATE DYNAMICS AND GEOLOGY. THE WATER CYCLE IS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE MARTIAN CLIMATE SYSTEM  YIELDING A SIGNIFICANT FEEDBACK ON THE CLIMATE THROUGH ITS EFFECTS ON SURFACE ALBEDO VIA FORMATION OF ICES AND ON ATMOSPHERIC EMISSIVITY AND REFLECTIVITY VIA CLOUDS. CLOUDS ALSO INTERACT WITH THE ATMOSPHERIC DUST DISTRIBUTION VIA THE MICROPHYSICS OF CLOUD PARTICLE EVOLUTION  YIELDING ADDITIONAL MODIFICATION OF ATMOSPHERIC RADIATIVE FORCING. WHILE THE MAJOR PROCESSES OF THE WATER CYCLE  AND ITS INTERACTIONS WITH THE DUST AND CO2 CYCLES  HAVE BEEN SKETCHED IN OUTLINE FOR SEVERAL DECADES  THE SPECIFICS OF HOW THE WATER CYCLE IS CONTROLLED REMAIN UNCERTAIN  E.G. THE IMPORTANCE OF REGOLITH EXCHANGE. THE NATURE OF THE NORTHERN CAP AS A DOMINANT WATER SOURCE AND THAT OF BOTH THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH AS SINKS AGAIN SEEMS CERTAIN IN OUTLINE  BUT THE DETAILS OF HOW THESE SOURCES AND SINKS FUNCTION HAS NOT RECEIVED MUCH ATTENTION AND MAY DOMINATE THE EFFICACY OF HOW THE WATER (AND RELATED CLIMATE) CYCLES ARE CONTROLLED GLOBALLY. CRISM DATA SUGGEST SIGNIFICANT LOCAL CYCLING AND IN SOME CASES BURIAL OF ANNUAL WATER LAYERS  WHICH IS LIKELY THE BASIS FOR POLAR LAYER FORMATION  AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHICH WOULD BE KEY TO UNRAVELING THE RECORD OF CLIMATE STORED IN THESE LAYERS. WE PROPOSE TO USE THE PLANETWRF MODELING SYSTEM TO UNDERTAKE IDEALIZED LOCAL THERMAL / WATER EXCHANGE MODELING OF SPECIFIC SITES OBSERVED BY CRISM  TO UNDERTAKE RESOLVED-SCALE SEASONAL MODELING OF THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CAPS  AND TO UNDERTAKE MULTI-ANNUAL MODELING OF THE CLIMATE SYSTEM USING LSM SCHEMES DEVELOPED WITHIN THIS PROJECT. NEW DATA PRODUCTS FROM CRISM WILL BE DEVELOPED AS NEEDED WITHIN THE ANALYSIS. THIS PROPOSAL IS RELEVANT TO THE MARS DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAM AS IT SEEKS TO UNDERTAKE WORK NECESSARY FOR THE ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF MARS SPACECRAFT MISSION DATA AND WILL HEAVILY USE MISSION DATA IN THE GENERATION OF IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF THE MARTIAN CLIMATE SYSTEM. IT WILL ALSO IMPROVE ATMOSPHERIC MODELS THAT FURTHER THE UNDERSTANDING AND FORECASTING OF ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT SAFE PASSAGE OF SPACECRAFT THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE.

TIDES AND PLANETARY WAVES (PWS) ACHIEVE LARGE AMPLITUDES AND EXHIBIT STRONG VARIABILITY IN THE MESOSPHERE  LOWER THERMOSPHERE  AND IONOSPHERE (MLTI). THESE MOTIONS DRIVE GLOBAL DYNAMO ELECTRIC FIELDS AND CURRENTS AND PRECONDITION THE IONOSPHERE FOR VARIOUS PLASMA INSTABILITIES. SMALLER-SCALE GRAVITY WAVES (GWS) PROPAGATING FROM SOURCES IN THE LOWER ATMOSPHERE OR EXCITED IN THE MLT BY SOLAR AND TERRESTRIAL FORCING ALSO PLAY KEY ROLES IN REGIONAL AND GLOBAL DYNAMICS. THEIR EFFECTS ARE EXPECTED TO INCLUDE STRONG REGIONAL VARIABILITY IN WINDS  NEUTRAL AND PLASMA DENSITIES  ACCOMPANYING FIELDS AND CURRENTS  LARGE ENERGY AND MOMENTUM INPUTS INTO THE MLT  AND SEEDING OF EPBS AND TIDS FROM EQUATORIAL TO HIGHER LATITUDES.

SERENDIPITOUS IMAGING OF SMALL SCALE INSTABILITY AND TURBULENCE STRUCTURES IN POLAR MESOSPHERIC CLOUDS PMCS BY STAR CAMERAS SUPPORTING THE EBEX STRATOSPHERIC BALLOON EXPERIMENT HAS DEMONSTRATED THE POTENTIAL FOR SUCH OBSERVATIONS. THESE IMAGES REVEAL INSTABILITY AND TURBULENCE DYNAMICS EXTENDING FROM A FEW KM TO  10 20 M SCALES  PIXEL RESOLUTION OF 3 M  AND OFFER A NEW WINDOW ON THESE DYNAMICS THAT WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY POSSIBLE WITH ANY MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE. THE KEYS TO THIS SENSITIVITY LIE IN THE VERY THIN PMC LAYER BRIGHTNESS WHERE ADVECTION CAUSES STRONG PMC THINNING AND IMAGING FROM ABOVE ATMOSPHERIC TURBULENCE AT LOWER ALTITUDES.

BOUNDARY LAYER INFORMATION (WHICH LARGELY CONFINES THE CH4 (SHAKHOVA) WILL IMPROVE CH4 RETRIEVALS FROM AIRS IASI THROUGH BETTER ADDRESSING THERMAL PROFILE CONTRAST EFFECTS.THIS STUDY ADDRESSES KEY SCIENCE QUESTIONS:1. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT SST POORLY CHARACTERIZES UPPER ARCTIC OCEAN WATER-COLUMN WARMING AND THAT PARAMETERS LIKE ALGAL OCEAN COLOR  SEA ICE PERSISTENCE  AND SEABED CH4 EMISSIONS ARE BETTER CORRELATED.2. HOW DOES THE MARINE ARCTIC CH4 CONTRIBUTION AND GROWTH COMPARE WITH TERRESTRIAL CH4 ARCTIC CONTRIBUTION AND GROWTH LEADING TO ACCELERATING AND REGIONALLY SIGNIFICANT ARCTIC WARMING?3. WHAT ARE THE TEMPORAL (SEASONAL AND INTER-ANNUAL) TRENDS OF THESE SOURCES AND EMISSIONS?4. HOW DOES VARIABILITY IN OCEAN PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS AND PRODUCTIVITY RELATE TO SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE  WATER COLUMN STABILITY (HEATING  ICE MELT  RIVERINE AND PRECIPITATION INPUTS)  AND PHOTOSYNTHETICALLY ACTIVE RADIATION (PAR) RELATE TO ICE-FREE PERIODS? HOW DO THESE TEMPERATURE-INFLUENCED PARAMETERS CORRELATE WITH CH4 EMISSIONS?5. HOW DO THE INTER-ANNUAL TRENDS IN ICE COVER (FROM MODIS  AVHRR  AND VARIOUS MICROWAVE SATELLITE DATA) RELATE TO PARAMETERS KNOWN TO VARY WITH WATER COLUMN TEMPERATURE AND SST?IN THIS STUDY  WE WILL PROVIDE: 1. HISTORICAL TRENDS OF KEY ARCTIC PARAMETERS TO BE ANALYZED WITH PUBLISHED HISTORICAL TRENDS IN ARCTIC OCEAN TEMPERATURES TO IDENTIFY THE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT HEAT INPUT SOURCES ON CLIMACTIC AND OTHER TEMPORAL SCALES (EL NINO  ECONOMIC CYCLES  SEASONAL  SPRING THAW  ETC.). 2. DIFFERENT SOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS IN BOTH THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DOMAINS WILL BE IDENTIFIED USING PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS AND OTHER STATISTICAL APPROACHES. 3. GUIDANCE FOR FUTURE ARCTIC TIR CH4 SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING DESIGN WILL BE PROVIDED BY COMPARISON OF AIRS AND IASI-DERIVED CH4 ABUNDANCE FOCUSING ON THE RELATIVE MERITS OF DIFFERENT CH4 ABSORPTION FEATURES. 4. COMPARISON BETWEEN AIRS V6  IASI (NOAA AND OTHER RETRIEVAL ALGORITHMS) AND GOSAT CH4 DATA AT MID-UPPER LATITUDES.","","2018","$781,195","$0","$781,195","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","California", "","","","",""
"G & A TECHNICAL SOFTWARE INC","","United States","","","","","THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WOULD ADDRESS SMALL-SCALE GRAVITY WAVE  INSTABILITY  AND TURBULENCE DYNAMICS THAT PLAY CENTRAL ROLES IN THE TRANSPORT AND DEPOSITION OF ENERGY AND MOMENTUM THROUGHOUT THE ATMOSPHERE. THESE DYNAMICS ARE KEY TO DEFINING THE LARGE- AND SMALLER-SCALE STRUCTURE AND VARIABILITY OF THE MLT  AND THEIR NEUTRAL AND IONOSPHERIC INFLUENCES EXTENDING TO HIGHER ALTITUDES. DESPITE THEIR IMPORTANCE  AND NUMEROUS PREVIOUS STUDIES  THESE DYNAMICS ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD AT PRESENT. MULTIPLE ROCKET AND GROUND-BASED STUDIES HAVE PROVIDED IMPORTANT ADVANCES DEFINING LARGER-SCALE ENVIRONMENTS AND GRAVITY WAVES  THE TYPES AND SCALES OF INSTABILITIES  AND MEASURES OF THE INTENSITY AND VARIABILITY OF TURBULENCE AT SMALLER SPATIAL SCALES. HOWEVER  NO PREVIOUS EXPERIMENT HAS SIMULTANEOUSLY DEFINED 1) THE SPATIAL CONTEXT OF THE DRIVING GRAVITY WAVE AND INSTABILITY DYNAMICS OVER EXTENDED HORIZONTAL SCALES  2) THE TRANSITION FROM LARGER-SCALE INSTABILITIES TO TURBULENCE  AND 3) THE EVOLVING INSTABILITY AND TURBULENCE CHARACTER EXTENDING TO THE TURBULENCE  INNER  SCALE CONTINUOUSLY IN TIME THROUGHOUT THE EVENT. SERENDIPITOUS IMAGING OF SMALL-SCALE INSTABILITY AND TURBULENCE STRUCTURES IN POLAR MESOSPHERIC CLOUDS (PMCS) BY STAR CAMERAS SUPPORTING THE EBEX STRATOSPHERIC BALLOON EXPERIMENT HAS DEMONSTRATED THE POTENTIAL FOR SUCH OBSERVATIONS. THESE IMAGES REVEAL INSTABILITY AND TURBULENCE DYNAMICS EXTENDING FROM A FEW KM TO ~10-20 M SCALES (PIXEL RESOLUTION OF 3 M) AND OFFER A NEW WINDOW ON THESE DYNAMICS THAT WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY POSSIBLE WITH ANY MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE. THE KEYS TO THIS SENSITIVITY LIE IN THE VERY THIN PMC LAYER BRIGHTNESS WHERE ADVECTION CAUSES STRONG PMC THINNING AND IMAGING FROM ABOVE ATMOSPHERIC TURBULENCE AT LOWER ALTITUDES. OUR PROPOSED EXPERIMENT WOULD EXPAND PMC IMAGING CAPABILITIES SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY. NEW IMAGING USING VERY-HIGH-RESOLUTION (50 MPIXEL) DETECTORS AND CO-ALIGNED WIDE AND NARROW FIELDS OF VIEW (FOV) WOULD EXTEND HORIZONTAL SPATIAL COVERAGE FROM ~100 KM TO ~10-M SCALES WITH IMAGING RESOLUTION AS HIGH AS 2 M. A FIXED ANTI-SUN VIEWING PLATFORM WOULD ALLOW TRACKING OF ENTIRE EVENTS THROUGHOUT THEIR EVOLUTION EXTENDING MANY BUOYANCY PERIODS (E.G.  AN HOUR OR LONGER) WITH 2-S RESOLUTION. HIGH-RESOLUTION MODELING OF GRAVITY WAVE  INSTABILITY  AND TURBULENCE DYNAMICS THAT HAS ALREADY YIELDED TANTALIZING COMPARISONS OF SIMULATED AND OBSERVED DYNAMICS WOULD BE EMPLOYED TO GUIDE QUANTIFICATION OF THE OBSERVED EVENTS. THE FLIGHT PROGRAM WOULD UTILIZE A SMALL OR MID-SIZE CONSTANT-PRESSURE BALLOON FLOWN FROM MCMURDO STATION  ANTARCTICA FOR A FLIGHT OF 1-2 WEEKS ALLOWING ONE ORBIT AROUND THE ANTARCTIC VORTEX IN AUSTRAL SUMMER. A LAUNCH WINDOW FROM 15/12/2017 TO 15/01/2018 WOULD GUARANTEE HIGH SENSITIVITY BY OUR IMAGERS TO THE MULTI-SCALE DYNAMICS REVEALED IN PMC IMAGERY. THE EXPERIMENT WOULD LEVERAGE EBEX IMAGING HERITAGE  THE PROVEN CSBF SOLAR POWER AND COURSE POINTING SYSTEMS  AND ELECTRONICS AND SOFTWARE TO MINIMIZE RISK IN COST AND THE DEVELOPMENT TIMESCALE. THE ENTIRE PAYLOAD WOULD WEIGH ~1000 LBS  FACILITATING A RELATIVELY SIMPLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE LAUNCH. MINIMUM TELEMETRY WOULD BE NEEDED TO EVALUATE IMAGER PERFORMANCE DURING THE MISSION  WITH DATA STORED ONBOARD UNTIL RETRIEVAL OF THE PAYLOAD FOLLOWING THE MEASUREMENT PROGRAM. THE PAYLOAD WOULD BE DELIVERED TO THE NASA BALLOON FACILITY IN PALESTINE  TX FOR TESTING AND SHIPPING TO MCMURDO ~4 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ANTICIPATED LAUNCH WINDOW. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WOULD HAVE SPECIFIC RELEVANCE TO GOALS 2 AND 4 IN THE RECENT HELIOPHYSICS DECADAL SURVEY  SOLAR AND SPACE PHYSICS: A SCIENCE FOR A TECHNOLOGICAL SOCIETY: - DETERMINE THE DYNAMICS AND COUPLING OF EARTH S MAGNETOSPHERE  IONOSPHERE  AND ATMOSPHERE AND THEIR RESPONSE TO SOLAR AND TERRESTRIAL INPUTS  - DISCOVER AND CHARACTERIZE FUNDAMENTAL PROCESSES THAT OCCUR BOTH WITHIN THE HELIOSPHERE AND THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE.","","2018","$788,280","$0","$788,280","NASA Science Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.001","","Virginia", "","","","",""

"STONE AEROSPACE  INC.","","United States","","","","","ROBOTIC EXPLORATION AND LIFE SEARCH ON OCEAN WORLDS REQUIRES THE ABILITY TO ACCESS HABITABLE OCEAN ENVIRONMENTS CONCEALED BENEATH THICK ICE CRUSTS. ADDITIONALLY  AN INSTRUMENT SUITE IS REQUIRED TO PERFORM THE COMPLICATED TASK OF AUTONOMOUS LIFE DETECTION. WE PROPOSE TO ADDRESS THESE TECHNOLOGICAL AND OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OCEAN WORLD ACCESS WITH THOR  A ROBUST CRYOBOT CAPABLE OF RAPID (10 M/HR)  DEEP (500+ M) SUBGLACIAL ACCESS THAT CARRIES AN ONBOARD SCIENCE PAYLOAD OPTIMIZED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION AND LIFE DETECTION. THOR WILL BE DEPLOYED AT THE EASTERN SKAFTAFELL SUBGLACIAL LAKE IN VATNAJOKULL  ICELAND WHERE IT WILL PENETRATE THE THICK ICE COVER OF THE LAKE. SUCCESSFUL FIELDING OF THOR WILL MARK THE FIRST CRYOBOT DESCENT INTO A SUBGLACIAL LAKE  THUS ENABLING UNIQUE INVESTIGATIONS OF BOTH THE LAKE'S GEOMICROBIOLOGY AND OF CONOPS STRATEGIES FOR A CRYOBOT'S ENTRY INTO  AND DESCENT THROUGH  A SUBGLACIAL BODY OF WATER. THE THOR TEAM LEVERAGES SUCCESSFUL WORK FROM THE VALKYRIE AND SPINDLE PROJECTS AND OFFERS FIDELITY TO PSTAR IN THE AREAS OF SCIENCE  SCIENCE OPERATIONS  AND TECHNOLOGY. A) SCIENCE: INVESTIGATIONS OF THE EASTERN SKAFTAFELL LAKE WILL CENTER AROUND DETECTING AND CHARACTERIZING MICROORGANISMS IN THE WATER COLUMN AND VOLCANIC VENTS TO DECIPHER THE CONTRIBUTION OF CHEMICAL ENERGY LIBERATED FROM GEOTHERMAL VS. GLACIOLOGICAL PROCESSES. TO AID THESE INVESTIGATIONS  THOR WILL CARRY A SUITE OF INSTRUMENTS CHOSEN TO CHARACTERIZE THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE ICE AND SUBGLACIAL LAKE  WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON LIFE-DETECTION STRATEGIES. ONBOARD INSTRUMENTS WILL INCLUDE A FLUORESCENCE SPECTROMETER  A HOLOGRAPHIC MICROSCOPE CAPABLE OF IMAGING PROKARYOTIC CELLS  AN INORGANIC CHEMISTRY MEASUREMENT SUITE  A TRANSMISSOMETER / BACKSCATTERING SENSOR  AND A WATER SAMPLER. A NANOPORE DNA SEQUENCER WILL BE USED ON-SITE TO ANALYZE WATER SAMPLES ACQUIRED BY THOR. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WILL UTILIZE WATER COLUMN AND VENT MATERIAL SAMPLES  WHICH WILL BE RETURNED TO THE SURFACE AND ANALYZED. B) SCIENCE OPERATIONS: AT SKAFTAFELL THE THOR CRYOBOT WILL PENETRATE A 300 M THICK GLACIER AND ENTER THE SUBGLACIAL LAKE IN THE VOLCANO'S CRATER. UPON REACHING THE ICE-WATER INTERFACE  THE CRYOBOT WILL TRANSITION INTO AN INSTRUMENT SONDE AND SPOOL ITSELF TO THE LAKE FLOOR WHILE SAMPLING AND ANALYZING THE WATER COLUMN. THIS PENETRATOR-TO-SONDE STRATEGY IS A NEW STEP-WISE APPROACH TO THE INITIAL EXPLORATION OF AN ALIEN OCEAN. AS THE VEHICLE DESCENDS INPUT FROM THE SENSOR SUITE WILL GOVERN DECISION-TO-COLLECT BEHAVIORS TO TRIGGER PROCESSES SUCH AS WATER SAMPLING. THE SYSTEM WILL BE RETRIEVED AFTER EACH MISSION AND WE ANTICIPATE COMPLETING SEVERAL DESCENTS IN EACH OF TWO FIELD SEASONS. EXPLORING METHODS WHICH COULD BE USED TO DETECT EXTANT LIFE ON OCEAN WORLDS IS OF HIGH IMPORTANCE. TO THAT END  WE WILL ASSESS HOW WELL AND IN WHAT WAYS THE SUITE OF INSTRUMENTS FUNCTION TOGETHER TO DETERMINE WHETHER LIFE IS PRESENT AND AT WHAT QUANTITIES. CONVENTIONAL LIMNOLOGICAL AND MICROBIOLOGICAL TECHNIQUES USING WATER SAMPLES ACQUIRED BY THOR WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE AUTONOMOUS SAMPLING DECISIONS. C) TECHNOLOGY: THE CRYOBOT DESIGN WILL USE A CLOSED-CYCLE HOT WATER DRILL APPROACH WHEREIN THE WATER IS HEATED IN A NOVEL WAY: HIGH VOLTAGE IS APPLIED ACROSS A FLOWING COLUMN OF WATER  WHICH SERVES AS THE RESISTIVE ELEMENT IN AN ELECTRO-RESISTIVE HEATER. ENERGY TRANSFER FROM THE ELECTRICAL SOURCE TO THE WATER IS INSTANTANEOUS AND OCCURS AT 100% EFFICIENCY.

THE FLIGHT ELF CAN ACHIEVE PRISTINE MOLTEN AND SUPERCOOLED SAMPLES. SUCH SAMPLES CAN BE STUDIED USING NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENTS OF TEMPERATURE  VOLUME  SURFACE TENSION AND VISCOSITY. SPHERICAL SAMPLES CA. 2 MM IN DIAMETER SUITABLE FOR EXPERIMENTS IN THE FLIGHT ELF WILL BE MADE BY LASER HEARTH MELTING. PRIOR GROUND-BASED WORK DEMONSTRATED THAT THE SAMPLE MATERIALS CAN BE: (I) LEVITATED USING ELECTROSTATIC METHODS  (II) HEATED USING LASER BEAMS  AND (III) MELTED WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT EVAPORATION. PROPOSED GROUNDBASED WORK WILL PUSH THE LIMITS OF THESE MEASUREMENTS AND HELP TO OPTIMIZE THE METHODS FOR ANALYSIS FOR THE FLIGHT DATA.","","2018","$119,498","$0","$119,498","NASA Space Operations Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.007","","Illinois", "","","","",""
"NOSANOV CONSULTING LLC","","United States","","","","","PERISCOPE IS AN INSTRUMENT AND MISSION CONCEPT WITH THE GOAL OF INVESTIGATING AND MAPPING LUNAR SKYLIGHTS FROM AN ORBITING PLATFORM USING PHOTON TIME OF FLIGHT IMAGING. A SPACECRAFT IN A VERY LOW ORBIT WOULD DIRECT LASER PULSES INTO THE LUNAR SKYLIGHTS  DETECT LIGHT RETURNING TO THE SPACECRAFT AFTER MULTIPLE REFLECTIONS IN THE CAVE  AND TRANSMIT A SUMMARY OF THOSE DATA BACK TO THE EARTH. A TEAMON THE GROUND WOULD PROCESS THAT DATA TO DEVELOP A 3D MAP OF THE INTERIOR VOID OF THE SKYLIGHT THAT WAS AT ALL TIMES BEYOND THE DIRECT LINE OF SIGHT OF THE SPACECRAFT.IN PHASE I WE SHOWED THE THEORETICAL FEASIBILITY OF THIS MISSION CONCEPT WITH A VARIETY OF SIMULATIONS AND ANALYTICAL TOOLS. IN PHASE II WE INTEND TO BRING THIS CONCEPT TO A LEVEL CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING A FULL MISSION PROPOSAL. WE WILL PERFORM MORE DETAILED TRADE STUDIES ANALYSES  AND EXPERIMENTS USING REAL WORLD MATERIALS AS ANALOGOUS TO EXPECTED LUNAR SUBSURFACE MATERIAL AS POSSIBLE.","","2018","$314,000","$0","$314,000","NASA Space Operations Grants","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","federal grant","","","","","USA Spending: http://www.usaspending.gov/","Year is fiscal year.","federal","43.007","","District of Columbia", "","","","",""
